<br />THREE BLACK BOXES</h2>
<p>As Johnny Thompson put out a hand to
ring the door bell of that brownstone
house facing the deserted grounds of the Chicago
Century of Progress and the lake, the
door opened without a sound. He looked up,
expecting to see a face, hear a voice, perhaps.
The voice came: &ldquo;Step inside, please.&rdquo; But
there was no face. The space before him was
empty.</p>
<p>A little puzzled, he stepped into the narrow
passageway. Instantly in a slow, silent manner
that seemed ominous, the door closed behind
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>The place was all but dark. Certainly there
was no lamp; only a curious blue illumination
everywhere. A little frightened, he put out a
hand to grip the door knob. It did not give to
his touch. Indeed it was immovable as the
branch of an oak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked!&rdquo; he muttered. Then for a space
of seconds his heart went wild. From the wall
to the right of him had flashed a pencil of
white light. Like an accusing finger it fell
upon something on the opposite wall. And that
something was an eye, an eye in the wall,&mdash;or
so it seemed to the boy. And even as he
stared, with lips parted, breath coming short
and quick, the thing appeared to wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eye!&rdquo; he whispered, and again, &ldquo;the
eye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a space of many seconds, like a bird
charmed by a snake, he stood staring at that
eye.</p>
<p>And then cold terror seized him. In the
corner of the place he had detected some movement.
It was off to his right. Whirling about,
he found himself staring at&mdash;of all the terrible
things in that eerie light&mdash;a skeleton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>And even as he stared, ready to sink to the
floor in sheer terror, the skeleton appeared to
move, to tremble, to open and close its fleshless
hands.</p>
<p>He watched the thing for ten terrible seconds.
Then a thought struck him with the
force of a blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;&rdquo; he whispered as if afraid the thing
might hear, &ldquo;that is me! That is my own
skeleton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of this there could be no doubt. For, as he
lifted his right hand, the skeleton did the
same. As he bobbed his head, the thing before
him bobbed. And if further evidence were
lacking, the thing had a crooked third finger,
and so had he.</p>
<p>Then, as if ashamed of being discovered, the
terrifying image vanished and the eye in the
wall blinked out. Instantly the door at the
inner end of the hall opened. There, standing
in a flood of mellow light, was a girl of about
his own age. She was smiling at him and shaking
her mass of golden hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she welcomed. &ldquo;But&mdash;but you
seem so frightened!&rdquo; She stared at him for a
second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; There was consternation in her tone.
&ldquo;Felix left that terrible thing on! How can
you ever forgive us?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But please do come in.&rdquo; Her tone changed.
&ldquo;You came about Father&rsquo;s books? How generous
of you. Poor Father! His head is so
full of things! He is always forgetting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny stepped inside. The door closed itself
noiselessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a house of magic is this?&rdquo;
he asked himself. &ldquo;Doors close themselves.
Eyes gleam at you from the wall. You see
your own skeleton in the dark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room he had entered seemed ordinary
enough&mdash;plain furniture, a davenport, chairs,
a table. But the light! He stared about him.
The room was filled with mellow light, yet
there was not a single lamp to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comes from everywhere and nowhere, that
light,&rdquo; he whispered to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take your hat.&rdquo; The girl held out
her hand. She seemed a nice sort of girl, rather
boyish. When she walked it was with a
long stride, as if she were wearing knickers
on a hike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll call Father.&rdquo; She marched across
the floor.</p>
<p>Johnny started from his chair, then settled
back. Had he caught the gleam of an eye
blinking from the wall? He thought so. But
now it had vanished.</p>
<p>The girl was still three paces from the door
at the back of the room when, with a silence
that was startling, that door swung open.</p>
<p>Johnny looked closely. The hall beyond was
lighted. There was no one to be seen.</p>
<p>As if this was quite the usual thing, the girl
marched straight through the open door. At
once it closed behind her.</p>
<p>Johnny was alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>If you have followed his career in our other
books you will know that Johnny is no coward.
He had been in tight places more than
once. Persons much older than he had said
he bore up under strain remarkably well. For
all that, this place gave him the creeps. That
it was not in the best part of the city he knew
well enough. This brownstone house, as we
have already said, was just across from the
deserted Century of Progress grounds, and
faced the lake. Back of it were shabby tenements
and dingy shops where second-hand
goods were sold and where auctioneers hung
out their red flags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather senseless, the whole business,&rdquo; he
mumbled to himself. &ldquo;Fellow gets into all
sorts of strange messes trying to fight other
people&rsquo;s battles for them. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts broke off. A small red light
like an evil eye flashed above the outer door,
then blinked out. A faint buzzing sound came
from a clock-like affair on the wall. Then all
was silent as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The professor&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Queer place! Why did I come? Couldn&rsquo;t
help it really. It was the boxes&mdash;the three
black boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Ah yes, those three black boxes! First they
had intrigued him, then they had aroused his
interest and sympathy. After that there was
just nothing to it. He had invested all but his
last dollar in those three black boxes. Now he
was trying to get his money back and do
someone else a good turn as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it seems,&rdquo; he whispered to himself,
&ldquo;there are dragons in the way, gleaming eyes,
skeletons. All&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red light flashed again, three times. The
clock buzzed louder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish she&rsquo;d come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose to pace slowly back and forth across
this room of many mysteries.</p>
<p>It was truly strange, he thought, the course
of events leading up to this moment. After a
considerable stay in the wilds of Michigan he
had returned to the city of Chicago. On his
arrival he had gone at once to the shack. The
shack, on Grand Avenue, as you will know if
you have read &ldquo;Arrow of Fire,&rdquo; was occupied
by Drew Lane, a keen young city detective,
and such of his friends as happened to be
about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>To his great disappointment, Johnny had
found the shades down, the door locked. &ldquo;Must
be away,&rdquo; he told himself. At once he found
himself all but overcome by a feeling of loneliness.
Who can blame him? What is lonelier
than a city where one has not a single friend?</p>
<p>Johnny had other friends in Chicago. Doubtless
he would chance upon them in time. For
the present he was completely alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be rather amusing,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;to
try going it alone. Wonder how long it will
be before someone will slap me on the back
and shout, &lsquo;Hello, Johnny Thompson!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having recalled the fact that at noon on
every Tuesday of the year a rather unusual
auction was held, he had decided to dispel his
loneliness by mingling in the motley mob that
attended that auction.</p>
<p>There for an hour he had watched without
any great interest the auctioneer&rsquo;s hammer
rise and fall as he sold a bicycle, a box of
clocks, a damaged coffin, an artificial arm,
three trunks with contents, if any, two white
puppies in a crate and a bird in a cage&mdash;all
lost or damaged while being carried by a great
express company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>It was only when the Three Black Boxes
were trundled out that his interest was aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he heard the auctioneer say in a low
tone to a man seated near, &ldquo;is a professor&rsquo;s
library. He hasn&rsquo;t come to claim the shipment,
so we are forced to sell his books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A professor&rsquo;s library! Poor fellow! What
will he do without his books?&rdquo; Johnny had
said to the man next to him. &ldquo;A professor
without books is like a juggler without hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A professor&rsquo;s library.&rdquo; The words had intrigued
him. The very word professor had
a glorious sound to him. They had been so
good to him, the professors of his college.</p>
<p>Without more than half willing it, he had
begun bidding on those three heavy black
boxes filled with books. In the end they were
his, and his pockets were all but empty.</p>
<p>After the affair was over he had hunted up
the auctioneer and secured the name and address
of the professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sell the books back to him,&rdquo; he said to
the auctioneer. &ldquo;Surely he <i>must</i> have some
money, or will have in a month or two.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe.&rdquo; The auctioneer had shaken
his head. &ldquo;Lots of folks pretty poor these
days. Too bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; Johnny told himself as he continued
to pace the floor of that mysterious
room, &ldquo;is the professor&rsquo;s house. Seems more
like the haunts of an evil genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt an almost irresistible desire to find
his way out of the place and make a dash for
it. But there were the books. He must manage
to get his money back somehow. He had
hoped the professor might be able to pay him
the money and take the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cost hundreds of dollars in the first place,
those books,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he broke off to listen and stare.
Strange noises, curious flashes of light, and
then the door swung open. The golden-haired
girl appeared. The door closed behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be here soon.&rdquo; She seemed
breathless. &ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s working at something,
a&mdash;a sort of trap. Do you know,&rdquo; she whispered,
&ldquo;this is a terrible neighborhood&mdash;truly
frightful! That is why we live here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Curious sort of reason,&rdquo; the boy thought,
but he said never a word, for at that instant
the clock-like affair on the wall began buzzing
loudly, the red light blinked six times in quick
succession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; There was consternation in the girl&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>Seizing the astonished boy by the arm, she
dragged him to a corner of the room. There
he found himself looking at what appeared to
be a narrow strip of mirror.</p>
<p>Upon that mirror moving objects began to
appear. Before his astonished eyes these spots
arranged themselves into the form of two skeletons,
one tall, one short. Dangling from the
hip-bone of the tall skeleton was what appeared
to be a long knife. Again the girl whispered,
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the short skeleton! Trembling so it appeared
to dance, it slipped a knife along its
bony wrist to at last grip it firmly in its skeleton
fingers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>The girl touched a button here, another
there. The thing on the wall buzzed. Words
were spoken outside the door, indistinct words.
The skeletons disappeared. There came the
sound of a door closing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;re gone!&rdquo; The girl sighed.</p>
<p>Catching a slight sound of movement behind
him, Jimmy whirled about to find himself looking
into a pair of smiling blue eyes. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo;
he thought to himself, &ldquo;is the girl&rsquo;s father, the
professor.&rdquo; There were the same features, the
same shock of golden hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Professor Van Loon,&rdquo; the man said
in a voice that was low, melodious and dreamy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth here tells me you bought my books,&rdquo;
he went on. &ldquo;That was kind of you. We&rsquo;ve
been moving about a great deal. The books
have followed us here and there. Charges
piled up. Until quite recently money has been
scarce. Then, I confess, I forgot. In these days
one is likely to forget his choicest treasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the girl. &ldquo;Beth, who was at
the door just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men.&rdquo; She trembled slightly. &ldquo;They
carried knives, so I opened the door on the
outside. They&mdash;they hurried away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say!&rdquo; The professor chuckled dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Press the button, Beth,&rdquo; the professor said,
nodding his head toward the right wall. &ldquo;Our
guest will stay for cocoa and cakes, I am sure.
That right?&rdquo; he asked, turning to Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, yes,&rdquo; Johnny agreed.</p>
<p>The girl pressed a button like a lamp switch
in the wall.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s feelings were mixed. He wanted
to stay. These people interested him and there
were a hundred mysteries to solve,&mdash;living
skeletons, eyes blinking from the walls, self-opening
doors, lights that gleamed and clocks
that buzzed.</p>
<p>A fresh mystery was added when five minutes
later the girl pressed a second button and
a tray laden with cups, saucers, a plate of
cakes and a pot of steaming cocoa appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Eye&rsquo; did it for us,&rdquo; the professor explained
in a matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;In these
days one scarcely needs a servant even when
he is able to afford one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>Perhaps Johnny would have said, &ldquo;What is
the &lsquo;Eye&rsquo;?&rdquo; but at that moment the door at
the rear opened and a tall youth with tumbled
red hair appeared.</p>
<p>The professor rose. &ldquo;Son, meet Johnny
Thompson. Now we are all here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, two hours later, Johnny left this
place of enchantment, his head was in a whirl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just goes to show,&rdquo; he chuckled to himself,
&ldquo;that when you do an unusual stunt anything
may happen&mdash;just anything at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several things <i>had</i> happened in the last two
hours. He had come to have a high regard for
the professor and his family. He had received
payment in full for the professor&rsquo;s library and
a ten dollar bill thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy alive!&rdquo; the professor had exclaimed
when he hesitated to accept this extra ten. &ldquo;If
some shark that haunts those auctions had got
my books it would have cost me a small fortune
to redeem them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this had happened, and much more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best of all,&rdquo; Johnny whispered to himself,
&ldquo;I am no longer alone. I&rsquo;ve made a place for
myself.&rdquo; Just what sort of place it was, he did
not surely know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to have you cast in your lot
with us,&rdquo; the professor had said. &ldquo;A boy who
thinks of others, as you have done in this library
affair, is sure to be of service anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do strange and interesting things
here.&rdquo; The professor&rsquo;s eyes had twinkled.
&ldquo;Sometimes they are useful and practical;
sometimes they are not. Always they are absorbing,
at times quite too startling. At times
we have money, at others none. Just now we
are quite rich.&rdquo; He chuckled. &ldquo;Someone offered
us a great deal of money for an electric
contraption that sorts beans, sorts a car load
a day. Who wants that many beans?&rdquo; He
chuckled again. &ldquo;Anyway we have money and
they can sort beans. Money means material,
equipment for fresh experiments. You will
come with us?&rdquo; He squinted at Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes, sure.&rdquo; Johnny scarcely knew
what leg he was standing on. &ldquo;Queer business!&rdquo;
was his mental comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will exact only one promise,&rdquo; the professor
continued. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not pry into our secrets.
Such secrets as we entrust to you you
will divulge to no man. Do you promise?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll learn a lot and enjoy the work a
heap,&rdquo; the son had said to Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to know,&rdquo; the professor had
added in a sober tone, &ldquo;that if you come with
us you may be in some danger; in fact I&rsquo;m
quite certain that I can promise it, yet it will
never be foolhardy nor reckless danger. You&rsquo;ll
come to live with us. That is necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s O.K.,&rdquo; Johnny had agreed.</p>
<p>And now Johnny found himself outside in
the cool air of night, the lake breeze fanning
his cheek, wondering if it all&mdash;the living skeletons,
eyes blinking in the wall, the self-closing
doors&mdash;all had been a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; He crushed the roll of bills in his
pocket. &ldquo;No, it was real enough. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly two shadows materialized from a
doorway, one tall, one short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the two men of the living skeletons,
the ones that girl and I saw in the mirror!&rdquo;
he whispered, catching his breath sharply. If
there had been any question in his mind regarding
this last conclusion it was dispelled
instantly. An inch of white steel, a knife blade,
protruded from the short person&rsquo;s sleeve as he
muttered menacingly, &ldquo;Stand where you are!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />SOMETHING RATHER TERRIBLE</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson was no weakling.
He was a lightweight boxer. He had made
his way over the frozen wastes of Alaska and
through the jungles of Central America and
many other wild places as well. This city held
little terror for him.</p>
<p>As he faced the two strangers in the semi-darkness
of the street, he considered tackling
the little man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I tackle low I&rsquo;ll catch him off his guard,
bowl him over like a tenpin. But the other,
the tall one?&rdquo; Ah, there was the rub! He carried
a knife at his belt.</p>
<p>The boy could run, but at thought of that
he seemed to feel a twinge of pain from a
knife in his back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>As he stood there, nerves all aquiver, oddly
enough he thought of the mysterious eye
blinking out of the wall back there in the hall.
He wondered vaguely what it all meant and
how this affair was to end.</p>
<p>And then quite suddenly the affair of the
moment ended. The tall man uttered a low
grumble which Johnny did not understand.
Next instant the pair faded into the darkness,
leaving him free to go his way in peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange business, all of this,&rdquo; he murmured
to himself. He felt for the roll of bills that
had been paid him for the professor&rsquo;s library.
Yes, they were still there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Come back tomorrow.&rsquo; The professor
said that,&rdquo; he mumbled as he hurried
away. &ldquo;Said I would meet dangers. <span class="nowrap">W-e-l-l&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>He walked three blocks in deep thought.
The whole business had thus far been very
strange. What of the future?</p>
<p>How little he knew! Tomorrow lay before
him, and after that tomorrow and another tomorrow.
The task he had agreed to undertake
was strange beyond belief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Yet, for the most part ignorant of all this,
he slept well that night and appeared next
morning, suitcase in hand, ready for work at
the door of that mystery house. In the broad
light of day the place had lost much of its air
of mystery.</p>
<p>He was relieved to find Felix Van Loon sitting
on the doorstep waiting for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t have to run the gauntlet of eyes in
the wall and submit my skeleton for inspection
this time,&rdquo; he whispered to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on in and have a cup of coffee with
me before we get down to work,&rdquo; the other
boy welcomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be glad to,&rdquo; Johnny answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo; Felix said a moment later. He
pressed a button, then shot a wooden panel to
one side, revealing a recess.</p>
<p>In that dark hole in the wall things began
to happen. Two electric coils began to light
up. At the same time Johnny noted with a
start that two red eyes were gleaming from
the darkest corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eyes,&rdquo; Felix murmured. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll do your
work if you let them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Felix made no further comment. Johnny
did not feel free to ask questions about the
riddle of the &ldquo;Eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping into a chair, Felix stared for a full
two minutes at a crack in the floor. Then with
a start he sprang to his feet, threw open a
second panel and proceeded to draw forth a
steaming pot of coffee and a plate of toast.
Johnny recalled the professor&rsquo;s remarks regarding
the &ldquo;Eye&rdquo; but said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer place,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>As if reading his thoughts, Felix put down
his cup. &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s what they call an electrical
wizard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He does things no one
dreams of. Enjoys it a lot, he does. So do I.
But Father has a deep purpose in it all, thinks
electricity may help to save the race; anyway
that&rsquo;s what he calls it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more he lapsed into silence. Johnny
searched the dark corners of the room for peering
eyes, but could find none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through?&rdquo; Felix asked quite suddenly.
&ldquo;All right then, let&rsquo;s be on our way.&rdquo; He strode
across the room to catch up a kit of tools.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>A moment more and they were in the street
marching south. They had passed one brownstone
building and were approaching a second
when Felix drew Johnny into a doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to tell you, I guess.&rdquo; His voice was
low. &ldquo;Sort of warn you in case anything happens.
Bit irregular, the thing we are about
to do. If it frightens you after I&rsquo;ve told you,
just say so. Every fellow has a right!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he got a fresh start, &ldquo;Father was
once in the secret service. He became interested
at that time in working out devices for
trapping criminals. And they <i>should</i> be
trapped.&rdquo; His voice rose. &ldquo;Ninety per cent
of all crimes are committed by men who never
work. Professional criminals, they make life
unsafe for everyone. But Father doesn&rsquo;t trap
&rsquo;em. He just works out the traps. He&rsquo;s too
much interested in making things to think
much about using them himself. See that brick
place, second door over?&rdquo; His voice dropped.
&ldquo;Some queer ones live there&mdash;a tall one and a
short one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tall one and a short&mdash;! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not much time.&rdquo; Felix held up a hand.
&ldquo;Sleep late, those two, but not too late. Got
to get in and do some things before they come
downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re supposed to be changing some electric
light switch boxes, you and I. That is, if
we&rsquo;re caught. You&rsquo;re my helper. No breaking
in or anything like that. Got the key from the
owner. But if they come down, that tall one
and the short one, they might get a little rough.
See? Question is, are you still with me?&rdquo; he
concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundred per cent!&rdquo; There was no hesitation
in Johnny&rsquo;s tone. For all that, there was
a sense of dizziness in his head. He was seeing
again the living skeletons, one with a knife
on its hip, the other with a blade hanging from
its bony fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should we change the switch
boxes in that place?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rule one of our clan is, &lsquo;No questions
asked&rsquo;!&rdquo; Felix chuckled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>A moment more and a key turned in a lock.
They found themselves in an ancient parlor.
The place was dark and silent, reeking with
mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are.&rdquo; Felix handed Johnny a
large flashlight. &ldquo;Just focus that on my hands
while I work. Won&rsquo;t try to raise the shades.
Might disturb our friends upstairs. Might&mdash;Sh!
Listen!&rdquo; The red-haired boy backed
against the wall.</p>
<p>Involuntarily Johnny gripped the handle of
a hammer with his free hand. The memory of
a knife blade protruding from a sleeve was
fresh in his mind.</p>
<p>For a space of seconds the two boys remained
motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I heard something.&rdquo; Felix moved
forward. A moment more and his long capable
fingers, trembling slightly, were busy removing
an electric punch button from the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Hole&rsquo;s large
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diving into his kit, he brought out a small
metal box wrapped about with wires.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>After unwinding these wires, he stood again
at attention. Catching no sound, he resumed
his work. Pushing the wires through the hole
left by the removal of the punch button, he
slid them down between the walls, then prepared
to fit the black box into position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have been
better! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held up a finger for silence. There had
come a faint sound from above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a bare foot touching the floor,&rdquo; Johnny
thought. Once more he gripped his hammer
handle hard. If they were attacked he
would do his bit. But would that be enough?
Strange business this! A chill crept up his
spine.</p>
<p>Felix resumed his work. His fingers flew.
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d never know a
thing has been changed. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later he disappeared into the
depths of a large closet. What he did there
Johnny was not permitted to know. For a full
quarter of an hour, alternately chilling and
thrilling at every sound that reached his ears,
Johnny stood there on guard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; the other boy at last whispered in
his ear, &ldquo;we go this way.&rdquo; They passed through
a door and down a stair into a cellar dark as
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One minute here, and then for the outer
air.&rdquo; Felix moved forward cautiously. For all
that, his foot struck some object that gave
forth a low, hollow roar. At the same instant
there came from above an unmistakable sound
of movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming down the stairs,&rdquo; Felix breathed.
&ldquo;Going out to breakfast, perhaps. If they
don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re trapped like rats!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five long minutes they cowered there in the
dark. Then, satisfied that all was well, Felix
tucked some wires through a crack in the wall,
and they were away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo; A moment later in the
broad light of the street the inventor&rsquo;s son offered
Johnny a slim hand. &ldquo;I&mdash;I just wanted
to make sure. You weren&rsquo;t much afraid, were
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;&rdquo; The muscles in Johnny&rsquo;s
face hardened. &ldquo;Mean to say there really
wasn&rsquo;t any danger back there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Danger?&rdquo; Felix stared. &ldquo;Of course there
was danger! Those men were there, somewhere,
no doubt about that. They&rsquo;re bad ones
too! Up to something rather terrible, I imagine.
But then,&rdquo; he added as a sort of afterthought,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re not detectives. I only wanted
to get some things in there to try them out.
You may have a chance to help at that. There&rsquo;s
a lot of things to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not tomorrow.&rdquo; His brow wrinkled in
thought. &ldquo;Father and I will be away tomorrow.
Tell you what&mdash;that&rsquo;ll be all for today.
Why don&rsquo;t you come back day after tomorrow?
We&rsquo;ll try something out then, something
rather thrilling, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was to be thrilling, that thing they were
to try out; but the thrill was to be of a different
sort than that expected by Felix. Fate too
would step in and change the date for them.
Fate has a way of doing that little thing, as
Johnny had long since learned.</p>
<p>Gripping Felix&rsquo;s hand, Johnny hurried away
to catch a bus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time for one more auction,&rdquo; he
thought to himself. &ldquo;That other auction
brought me luck and promise of adventure.
Why might not another do the same? Might
go to the shack and see if Drew Lane is there,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;Do that after the auction is
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was going to the shack right enough,
but not in just the manner he would have
chosen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />THE BATTLE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There! That&rsquo;s the one! The one up
next!&rdquo; Johnny sat up with a start.
Arrived at the auction house where all manner
of strange things lost, damaged or stolen,
are sold, he had taken his place among the bidders.
He had found himself crowded in between
a thin man and a stout one. He knew
the stout one slightly; they called him John.
The slim man was new and quite strange for
such a place. His clothes were new and very
well kept. His face was dark. His lips were
twitchy, his slim fingers ever in motion. There
was on his left cheek a peculiar scar. Two
marks, like a cross, as if someone had branded
him, so Johnny thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>And now, to his great astonishment, after
dozing through a half hour of uninteresting
auction, he found this stranger whispering
shrilly in his ear. Before the whisper had come
he felt a sharp punch in the ribs. The punch
may have been made with a sharp elbow. Johnny
had an uncomfortable feeling that the business
end of some sort of short gun had been
stuck into his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he whispered back. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big
idea? This is an auction house; not a hop
joint!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know! I know!&rdquo; came in an excited whisper
from the slender, nervous-eyed man. &ldquo;But
listen to me!&rdquo; One more prod in the ribs.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember it the longest day you live!
You <i>bid</i> on that next package! And <i>get</i> it!
Take it away from &rsquo;em, see? Take it away!
Me? I&rsquo;m broke,&rdquo; the stranger went on hurriedly.
&ldquo;But I got a hunch. An&rsquo; my hunches,
they&rsquo;re open and shut, open and shut. Just
like that! So you bid! See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The package in question seemed about as
uninteresting as it well could be&mdash;a, plain corrugated
box tied round with a stout hempen
cord. There were scores quite like it. Some
were larger, some thinner, some thicker. Johnny
had seen many such packages opened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Broken bits of statuary,&rdquo; he thought to
himself, &ldquo;or old clothes, like as not, or jars of
cheap cosmetics. What do I want of that
package?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the stranger was insisting. &ldquo;Bid! Bid!
See, I got a hunch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bid?&rdquo; Johnny grumbled in a whisper.
&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The auction room was warm. He guessed
he must have fallen asleep. Always after a
nap he felt cross. He wouldn&rsquo;t bid on the silly
package. What if this fellow did have a hunch?
He had a mind to tell him so.</p>
<p>Strange to say, when the package went up,
he did bid. &ldquo;One dollar! Two! Three dollars!&rdquo;
And he had it.</p>
<p>He turned about to look into the slim stranger&rsquo;s
face; wanted to see how he felt about it.
To his surprise he found the seat empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo; he thought with a start.
&ldquo;Perhaps I dreamed the whole thing!... No,
not all of it,&rdquo; he amended ten seconds later.
&ldquo;Here comes the collector after my deposit.
I&rsquo;ve got a good mind to tell him I didn&rsquo;t buy
the package.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>This notion too he abandoned. Digging into
his watch-pocket, he dragged forth a crumpled
dollar bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., Buddie, you get your package after
the auction.&rdquo; The collector went his way.</p>
<p>Johnny had not meant to stay the auction
through. Now he must, or forfeit his dollar.
He debated this problem and decided to stay.
The package did not interest him overmuch,
but his money was up. He would have a look.</p>
<p>Losing all interest in the auction, he spent
his time thinking through his unusual adventures
of the night before. Closing his eyes, he
seemed to see again that frightful wavering
skeleton which in time he came to believe was
his own. Two other skeletons he saw, one
with a long-bladed knife wavering in its hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw them later on the streets, those men,&rdquo;
he told himself, &ldquo;only they were all dressed up
in flesh and had their skins on&mdash;clothes too.
It&rsquo;s a queer business! Eyes staring at a fellow
from the wall!&rdquo; He shuddered. &ldquo;Fairly
gives you the creeps! Wonder why I agreed
to join up with such an outfit as that old professor
and his children.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;People,&rdquo; he whispered after a long period
of deep thinking, &ldquo;certain people have a way
of getting inside of you and making you like
them. They may be very good and they may
be very bad, in certain ways, but you like them
all the same. And you&rsquo;ll follow them as a dog
follows his master. Queer old world! The professor
is like that, and so&rsquo;s his daughter. Fellow&rsquo;d
come to like the boy too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what we were up to in that strange
house,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Good thing we got out of
that cellar before anyone showed up! I doubt
if that boy&rsquo;s much of a fighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dumb!&rdquo; He stirred impatiently in his seat.
&ldquo;Got a lot more to sell at this auction. Radios,
somebody&rsquo;s trunks, &lsquo;with contents if any,&rsquo;
some puppies&mdash;hear &rsquo;em squeal!&mdash;pop-corn in
a sack, six broken lamps and a hundred more
things. Guess I&rsquo;ll get out. Buzz around here
after awhile and pick up that package.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>When he returned to the auction room two
hours later darkness was falling. A dull, drab
fog had come creeping in from the lake. Lights
glowed through it like great staring eyes. They
reminded him of the eyes in the wall at the
professor&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bought a package here,&rdquo; he grumbled to
the clerk. &ldquo;Some busted thing, I guess. Here&rsquo;s
the ticket and the rest of the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; The parcel man handed
out his prize package.</p>
<p>The thing was heavier than he had expected.
Prying up a corner of the box, he thrust
in a hand. He touched something round,
smooth and hard. &ldquo;Like a skull,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only some sort of electric lamp,&rdquo; he decided
after further exploring. &ldquo;Metal affair made
like a jug; broken, probably. Oh well, might
as well take it along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the auction room, he came out into
the street and headed west.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>That portion of the city is not inviting, nor
does it seem particularly friendly to well-dressed
strangers. During the day, when the
weather is fair, the cross streets swarm with
men who once worked, who may work again,
but who for the present stand and idly stare
or wander up and down.</p>
<p>This night was damp and chill. The street
was all but deserted. Halfway through a block
a chance flash of light from a passing car revealed
four well-dressed men standing at the
entrance to an alley.</p>
<p>One look, and Johnny sprang back. The
movement was purely instinctive. He had seen
faces like theirs before, in court rooms and behind
iron bars. Three of the men were in full
view, one in the shadow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the chance revelation of that
passing car came too late. Before he could
turn and show them his heels, they had him
surrounded.</p>
<p>That there would be a fight he did not question.
Why? He had not the remotest idea.</p>
<p>Johnny did not mind a fight, a clean fight.
He kept himself fit for just such an occasion
as this. He was always in training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But four of them!&rdquo; He groaned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>No ringside rules here. One of the men was
fat. Like a battering-ram, Johnny aimed his
head square at that one&rsquo;s stomach. The man
went over with a groan. But not Johnny. Regaining
his balance in a flash, he swung his
good right arm to bring his heavy package
squarely down upon a second man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>The package flew from his hand. In a fair
fight with one man, or even two, Johnny needed
only two well-formed fists. As the third
man sprang at him, he squared away to give
him an uppercut under the chin that closed
his jaws with the snap of a steel trap and put
him out for a count of twice ten.</p>
<p>But at that instant something crashed down
upon Johnny&rsquo;s skull. The fourth member of
the gang, he who had hovered in the shadows,
had gone into action.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later when a detective threw
the beam of his flashlight down that alley it
fell upon a lone figure huddled against the
wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>He was about to pass on, thinking it was
some poor wanderer fast asleep, when something
about the person&rsquo;s clothes caused him to
look again. Two long strides and he was beside
the prostrate form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Thompson, as I live!&rdquo; he muttered
after bending over for a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And somebody&rsquo;s got him! I wonder if it&rsquo;s
for keeps?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />BACK IN THE OLD SHACK</h2>
<p>Johnny was not out for good. But his
return to consciousness was gradual. He
began to hear things dimly as in a dream.
There was a certain melody and harmony
about the sounds, like a pipe organ played
softly at night. This was shot through at
times by a loud pop-pop-crack. Had memory
returned, the boy might have thought they
were fighting it out over his prostrate form,
those men and the police.</p>
<p>Memory did not return. A drowsy feeling
of painless well-being swallowed him up. He
did not struggle against it, did not so much
as wish to struggle. For all that, his eyes began
seeing things&mdash;one more step on the way
to full consciousness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>Like someone seen dimly in the clouds, as
they do it in the movies, a vaguely familiar
face appeared above him. A narrow, rather
dark, tense face it was, with large eyes that
seemed to burn with a strange fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joy&mdash;Joyce Mills,&rdquo; his lips whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Johnny. We&rsquo;re glad you&rsquo;re back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back?&rdquo; He pondered that last word. &ldquo;Back
to what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to feel things&mdash;a third step in his
return to the realm of reality. The cold fog
was gone, he knew that. The darkness too
was gone. A subdued light was all about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back,&rdquo; he thought once more, &ldquo;back to
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as if reading this thought, the girl
said, &ldquo;You are back in the shack on Grand Avenue.
Don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that all his memories came flooding in.
The shack, Drew Lane and Tom Howe, keen
young detectives, his staunch friends; Newton
Mills, the one-time derelict and veteran detective,
and Joyce Mills, his vivacious, ambitious
daughter who at times had proven herself the
keenest detective of them all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The shack!&rdquo; he exclaimed, making a brave
attempt to sit up. &ldquo;The shack! How&mdash;how
wonderful!&rdquo; He sank back dizzily. A sharp
pain had shot across his temples.</p>
<p>When this pain was gone, he gave himself
over entirely to memories. The girl&rsquo;s face had
vanished. Something told him, however, that
she was seated close by his side.</p>
<p>Memories, gorgeous, thrilling memories!
They would be with him until he died. He and
this slim, dark-haired girl had not been lovers;
much more than that, very much more. They
had been pals. And as pals they had shared
dangers. They had dared together and had
won. Drew Lane had been with them, Newton
Mills too, and Tom Howe. Men there had
been who would gladly have killed them. Yet,
standing side by side and fighting for the good
of all, they had won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo; He said the words aloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you have only to rest,&rdquo; came in that
same melodious voice. &ldquo;Someone hit you
rather hard on the head. That&rsquo;s what you get
for going it alone. You might have known
we were still in Chicago. You did not look us
up. You can&rsquo;t go it alone. No one can&mdash;not in
this world of today. We stand shoulder to
shoulder, or we don&rsquo;t stand at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now&mdash;&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s voice fell. &ldquo;Now you
are here in the shack and Drew Lane is here.
Others are not far away. You must rest.&rdquo; Her
voice trailed off into silence.</p>
<p>Johnny wanted to tell her he had tried to
find Drew Lane at the shack and had failed;
that he had not wished to go it alone, that he
did appreciate his friends. But somehow the
words would not come. His thoughts were
all mixed up with dreams, dreams of eyes
blinking from the wall, animated skeletons and
mysterious packages. Truth was, he had fallen
asleep.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>&ldquo;I went to an auction.&rdquo; Five hours Johnny
had slept on a cot in the corner of the large
room at the back of the shack. Now he was
sitting up on the cot, talking eagerly. From
beneath his crown of bandages his two eyes
gleamed like twin stars. &ldquo;I bought a library,
a professor&rsquo;s library, bought it at auction. Because
he was a professor I had to get it back
to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I found his address. I went there. I was
in the hall. Eyes gleamed at me. A skeleton
danced before me, my skeleton. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your skeleton?&rdquo; Drew Lane, the keen
detective, grinned at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it was my skeleton! Don&rsquo;t you suppose
a fellow knows his skeleton when he sees
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew Lane laughed, a low laugh, but made
no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Johnny went on rapidly, &ldquo;a girl
opened the door, a taffy-haired, boyish sort of
girl, and said she was sorry. It is a house of
magic, the &lsquo;House of a Thousand Eyes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eyes?&rdquo; Joyce Mills leaned forward eagerly.
&ldquo;What sort of eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;is what I don&rsquo;t know.
They seem to do things, those eyes, open doors
and shut &rsquo;em, make coffee maybe, I don&rsquo;t know.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going back. I want to know.
Oh! Don&rsquo;t I though!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going back?&rdquo; Drew smiled.</p>
<p>A large man sitting before the fire, a man
Johnny had never seen until that night, turned
and looked at him in a strange way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;m going back. I&rsquo;m to help them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help them at what?&rdquo; Drew Lane was curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s brow wrinkled.</p>
<p>Had Johnny been a little wider awake and
a little more alive, he would have realized that
the young detective and Joyce Mills were humoring
him as they might a drunken man.
&ldquo;He was hit on the head in that alley&mdash;I
found him and brought him here,&rdquo; Drew was
saying to himself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s slightly cuckoo from
that terrible bump he got. All this stuff he&rsquo;s
talking is sheer nonsense. He&rsquo;s delirious.
He&rsquo;ll come round all right.&rdquo; Joyce Mills was
thinking much the same. Not knowing their
thoughts, Johnny rambled on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We put some wires and things in a place
nearby. Two queer ones live there, a long one
and a short one. One carries a knife up his
sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nice friendly sort.&rdquo; Drew grinned. &ldquo;Was
he the fellow that hit you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit me?&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s hand went to his head.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I doubt that. It&mdash;it was a different place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully, &ldquo;they
might have followed me all that time. But
why? I hadn&rsquo;t done anything to them&mdash;not
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet? Are you going to later?&rdquo; Joyce
Mills gave him a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something tells me I am. Fellow gets
hunches, you know that. That old professor
interests me and so does that &lsquo;House of a
Thousand Eyes.&rsquo; He said there&rsquo;d be danger.
But who cares for danger?&rdquo; Once more his
hand went to his head. &ldquo;They&mdash;they didn&rsquo;t
get me, not yet. But if I find that fellow who
hit me with that iron bar&mdash;and I <i>will</i> find him,
don&rsquo;t doubt that&mdash;when I find him, well&mdash;&rdquo;
He did not finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo; Drew asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not out there in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the &lsquo;Wild Garden of Despair&rsquo;?&rdquo; Drew
laughed low. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call West
Madison Street. You didn&rsquo;t see him there,
did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew was beginning to believe that Johnny
was all right in his head after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the only one I didn&rsquo;t see.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s
tone was thoughtful. &ldquo;All the same, I have a
notion I&rsquo;ve seen him right enough. Unless
I&rsquo;ve got him all wrong, he sat beside me in
that auction house and prodded me in the
ribs, telling me to bid on a package I had no
notion of buying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you buy it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny told of his experience in the auction
house, then of the battle in the &ldquo;Garden of
Despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Drew said slowly
when the story was told. &ldquo;The fellow who
talked you into buying that package may have
belonged to the gang that beat you up in that
alley. Package was gone right enough when I
found you. You&rsquo;re sure there was nothing in
that box but a broken lamp?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t swear to that.&rdquo; Johnny dropped
back to his place on the cot. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t untie it;
just explored it with my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a toss-up,&rdquo; Drew concluded. &ldquo;Man who
carries a knife up his sleeve, or the fellow who
made you buy what you didn&rsquo;t want. One of
these hit you. Which one? Nice little riddle.
We&rsquo;ll help you solve it, won&rsquo;t we, Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and let me in on it!&rdquo; The large man
by the fire stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; Drew said, and there was a note
of deep respect in his voice, &ldquo;this is Captain
Burns, a chief in the detective bureau. He&mdash;he
seems to like being here in our shack now
and then. But keep it dark,&rdquo; he warned.
&ldquo;There are people who would like to meet the
Captain here in a very unsocial way&mdash;boys of
the under-world who&rsquo;ve felt his steel. Right,
Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; the Captain rumbled. &ldquo;Anyway,
I wouldn&rsquo;t want our happy retreat broken up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this &lsquo;House of a Thousand Eyes&rsquo;?&rdquo; He
turned to Johnny. &ldquo;Tell me more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Johnny with a broad grin,
&ldquo;when I have more to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />PAST AND PRESENT</h2>
<p>Several hours later, having quite recovered
from his severe headache, and apparently
not so very much the worse for the
terrible thump he had received on the head,
Johnny sat before the open fireplace in Drew
Lane&rsquo;s shack on Grand Avenue. About that
same fire were gathered his friends of other
days, Drew Lane, Tom Howe and Joyce Mills.
With them was the ruddy-faced, smiling Captain
Burns, one of the best known and most
feared officers of the law in that city.</p>
<p>If you have read &ldquo;Arrow of Fire&rdquo; you will
know that the &ldquo;Shack&rdquo; was the one remaining
structure of days long gone by when the east
end of Grand Avenue&mdash;which, after all, has
never been very grand&mdash;was at the edge of a
sandy marsh where in the autumn one might
hunt wild ducks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>This shack was now surrounded by tall
warehouses. Hidden away and quite forgotten,
it made a perfect meeting place for such
as Drew Lane and his little group of crime
hunters.</p>
<p>Drew Lane was still young. With his derby
hat, bright tie and natty suit, he looked still
very much the college boy he had been. Endowed
with great strength, trained to the limit,
with a brain like a brightly burning lamp,
he was the despair of evil doers. Scarcely less
effective was his team-mate, Tom Howe.
Small, freckled, active as a cat, silent, full of
thoughts, Tom planned, while, more often
than not, Drew executed.</p>
<p>Joyce Mills, as you may know, had become
a member of this group quite by accident. Her
father, Newton Mills, after many years of distinguished
service as a detective in New York,
had at last fallen a prey to strong drink.
Johnny and Drew had found him in Chicago
drinking his life away. They had saved him
to a life of further usefulness. Joyce, deeply
grateful, and always at heart a &ldquo;lady cop,&rdquo;
had cast her lot with them. And now here
she was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But your father?&rdquo; Johnny was saying to
her at this moment, &ldquo;where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shadow passed over the girl&rsquo;s dark face.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen him for two months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; she added in a lighter tone, &ldquo;you
know him. Gets going on something and forgets
everything else. He&rsquo;ll show up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny agreed, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s bound to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was thinking of the time the veteran
detective had turned himself into a gray shadow
and had, all unknown, dogged Johnny&rsquo;s
heels, saving him from all manner of terrible
deaths. The time was to come, and that soon
enough, when he was to wish the &ldquo;Gray Shadow&rdquo;
back on his trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew,&rdquo; Johnny said, turning to his sturdy
young friend, &ldquo;I came here the moment I
reached the city. How come the place was
locked up and dark?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Been on a vacation; just got back.&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s
face lighted. &ldquo;Went to the Rockies. Had some
wonderful hunting&mdash;grizzly bears. Can&rsquo;t say
that&rsquo;s more exciting than hunting crooks,
though,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Met a girl you&rsquo;d like on the way back.&rdquo;
Drew Lane turned to Joyce. &ldquo;Came on the
bus. People in a bus, traveling far, get to be
like one big family. Funny part was&mdash;&rdquo; He
gave a low chuckle. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming here to help
her uncle. He has a store on Maxwell Street.
Maxwell Street! Can you imagine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rags, scrap-iron, poultry in crates, fish
smells and noise&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Maxwell Street
means to me!&rdquo; Joyce shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that!&rdquo; Drew agreed. &ldquo;This truly nice
girl from somewhere in Kansas is going there
to help in her uncle&rsquo;s store. She doesn&rsquo;t know
a thing about Chicago. Thinks Maxwell Street
is all the same as State Street, I&rsquo;m sure. Believes
her uncle&rsquo;s store is anyway six stories
high. Well, she&rsquo;s in for a terrible shock. I feel
sorry for her. Have to get round and see her&mdash;gave
me the address. She asked me what I
did in Chicago.&rdquo; Drew chuckled once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you tell her?&rdquo; Joyce asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said I looked after people, lots of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And for once you told the truth,&rdquo; Johnny
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Johnny!&rdquo; Joyce exclaimed. &ldquo;Tell me
some more about this &lsquo;House of Magic&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve
discovered. Sounds frightfully interesting.
We all thought you were a little delirious when
you first talked of it. But now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you begin to believe me.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s
eyes shone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a truly wonderful place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us about it.&rdquo; Captain Burns insisted
from his corner. &ldquo;Heard about some of these
things before. Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if they&rsquo;d do
things in the end to lift the load off us poor,
over-worked detectives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know, which isn&rsquo;t much,&rdquo;
Johnny agreed.</p>
<p>And here I think we may safely leave our
friends for a little time while we look in upon
Grace Krowl, the girl from somewhere in Kansas.
She had found her uncle&rsquo;s store on Maxwell
Street. And how she had found it!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />A STORE IN CHICAGO</h2>
<p>A slender mite of a girl, barely past her
eighteenth birthday, Grace Krowl was
possessed of an indomitable spirit and a will
of her own; else she would not have been walking
down Maxwell Street in Chicago hundreds
of miles from her home, in Kansas.</p>
<p>The look in her eyes as she marched down
that street where all manner of junk and rags
are mingled with much that, after all, is pleasant
and desirable, was one of utter surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A store,&rdquo; she murmured, more than once,
&ldquo;a store in Chicago. And Maxwell Street. I
am sure I can&rsquo;t be wrong. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrived at the street number written on a
slip of paper in her hand, she stood staring at
the narrow, two-story building with its blank
windows and unpainted walls for a full moment.
Then, a spirit of desperation seizing
her, she sprang up the low steps, grasped the
doorknob, then stepped resolutely inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Once inside, she stood quite still. Never in
any place had she witnessed such confusion.
What place could this be? Her mind was in
a whirl. Then, like a flash, her eyes fell upon
an object that threw her into action. With a
startled cry, she sprang at a group of women.</p>
<p>She snatched a tortoise shell comb from a
huge black woman&rsquo;s hand just as she was
about to try it in her kinky hair. She dragged
a pink kimono from beneath a tall, slim woman&rsquo;s
arm and, diving all but headforemost,
gathered in a whole armful of garments that
an astonished little lady had been hugging
tight.</p>
<p>By this time the battle turned. She found
herself at the center of a concerted attack.
The black woman banged at her with a picture
frame, the tall, thin one jabbed her with
sharp elbows and the little lady made a grab
at her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies! Ladies!&rdquo; came in a protesting
man&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Why must you fight in my store?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fight? Who wants to fight!&rdquo; the tall woman
screamed. &ldquo;Here we are peaceful folks
looking over the goods in your store, and here
comes this one!&rdquo; She pointed an accusing
finger at Grace. &ldquo;She comes in grabbing and
snatching, that&rsquo;s what she does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Store! Goods!&rdquo; Grace&rsquo;s head was in a
whirl. How could they call this a store? It
was a place where people robbed strangers,&mdash;stole
their trunks and rifled them. Surely there
could be no mistaking that. Were not the
trunks open there before her, a half dozen or
more of them? And was not her own modest
steamer trunk among them? Had she not
caught them going through her trunk? Were
not the articles in her arms, the tortoise shell
comb, the kimono and those other garments
her very own? Goods? Store? What could it
all mean? Her head was dizzy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A store,&rdquo; she whispered to herself, &ldquo;my uncle&rsquo;s
store in Chicago. He gave me this address.
He must be in the business of stealing
trunks and selling their contents!&rdquo; She felt,
of a sudden, all hollow inside, and dropping
like an empty sack, half sat upon a partially
emptied trunk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss! Why do you do this?&rdquo; The bearded
man who now spoke was almost apologetic in
his approach. &ldquo;Why do you do this in my
store? Many years I, Nicholas Fischer, have
sold goods here and never before have I seen
such as this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nich&mdash;Nicholas Fischer!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes
widened. &ldquo;Then <i>you</i> are Nicholas Fischer.
And <i>this</i> is your store? STORE!&rdquo; she fairly
screamed.</p>
<p>She wanted to rise and flee, but she was half
stuck in the trunk and her wobbly legs would
not lift her out, so she said shakily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did it be&mdash;because that&rsquo;s my trunk. I&mdash;I
am Grace Krowl, your niece who came from
Camden Center, Kansas, to help you keep your
store. But I won&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t stay a moment.
I&rsquo;ll never, never, never help a thief!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; The bearded man&rsquo;s face was a
study. Surprise, mortification registered themselves
on his face. &ldquo;Grace Krowl, my niece,&rdquo;
he murmured. &ldquo;Her trunk! It is her trunk!
A thief it is she says I am&mdash;I, Nicholas Fischer,
who never stole a penny! Tell me, what is all
this?&rdquo; He stared from face to face as if expecting
an answer. But no answer came.</p>
<p>And then a slow smile overspread his face.
&ldquo;Now I begin to understand,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;It is all a mistake, a terrible mistake!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; he said, turning pleading eyes on
the group of customers, &ldquo;will you please put
back into that little trunk everything you have
taken out? And if any have paid for a thing,
I will repay. It is my niece&rsquo;s trunk. It is one
terrible mistake.&rdquo; He began rocking backwards
and forwards like one in great pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thief, she said,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;But who
would not have thought it?&rdquo; His eyes took in
the half-empty trunks all about him, then he
murmured again, &ldquo;Who would not have
thought it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four hours later, just after darkness had
fallen, this same girl, Grace Krowl, found herself
walking the most unusual street in America,
Maxwell Street in Chicago. She found it
interesting, amusing, sometimes a little startling,
and always unspeakably sad, this place
where a strange sort of bedlam reigns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Here, as she passed along, fat Jewish women
held up flimsy silk stockings to her view,
screaming, &ldquo;Buy, Miss, buy now! The price
goes up! Cheap! Cheap!&rdquo; Here a man seized
her rudely by the shoulder, turned her half
around and all but shoved her into a narrow
shop, where gaudy dresses were displayed.
This made her angry. She wanted to fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fight?&rdquo; She laughed softly to herself. &ldquo;I,
who have always lived in Camden Center! A
sort of madness comes over one in such a place
as this, I guess.&rdquo; Recalling her fight earlier
in the day, her cheeks crimsoned, and she hurried
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a jumble!&rdquo; she exclaimed aloud as
she turned her attention once more to Maxwell
Street. &ldquo;Shoes, scissors, radios, geese,
cabbages, rags and more rags, rusty hardware,
musical instruments. Where does it all come
from, and who will buy it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>She paused to look at a crate of cute white
puppies with pink noses. They, too, were for
sale. Then, of a sudden, her face clouded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I do it?&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Can I? I&mdash;I
must! But other people&rsquo;s things? So often the
little treasures they prized! How can I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That she might remove her thoughts from
a painful subject, she forced her eyes to take
in her present surroundings. Then, with a little
cry, she sprang forward. &ldquo;Books! &lsquo;Everything
in books.&rsquo;&rdquo; She read the sign aloud.
She disappeared through a dingy door into a
room which was brightly lighted. The lights
and the face that greeted her changed all. The
madly fantastic world was, for the moment,
quite shut out. She was at home with many
books and with a girl whose face shone, she
told herself, &ldquo;like the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A book?&rdquo; this sales girl smiled. &ldquo;Something
entertaining? A novel, perhaps. Oh no,
I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d like &lsquo;Portrait of a Man
with Red Hair.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s really rather terrible. One
of the chief characters is a mad man who loves
torturing people.&rdquo; The girl shuddered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But this now&mdash;&rdquo; She took up a well-thumbed
volume. &ldquo;&lsquo;A Lantern in Her Hand.&rsquo;
It is truly lovely&mdash;the story of brave and simple
people. I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re neither very brave
nor very simple these days. Do you feel that
we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She really is able to think clearly,&rdquo; Grace
whispered to herself. &ldquo;I am sure I am going
to like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take one, that one,&rdquo; she said putting
out her hand for the book. And then, because
she was alone in a great city, because she was
bursting to confide in someone, she said, &ldquo;He
buys trunks, trunks full of other people&rsquo;s
things. He takes the things out and sells them,
other people&rsquo;s things. They packed them away
with such care, and now&mdash;now he takes them
out, throws them about and sells them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who does?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle, Nicholas Fischer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nicholas Fischer.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s voice
dropped. &ldquo;But he is the kindest man! Comes
here with books. He sells them to Mr. Morrow
who owns this store&mdash;secondhand books.
Perhaps they come from the trunks. And Mr.
Morrow says he helps poor people, your uncle
does, and he doesn&rsquo;t let anyone know who it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But he buys trunks, other people&rsquo;s trunks,
and sells them!&rdquo; Grace insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, buys them at auction, I guess. Several
people on this street do that. Express
auctions, railway auctions, storage house auctions
and all that. And you are to help him
open them up!&rdquo; she exclaimed quite suddenly.
&ldquo;You are to explore them? How I envy you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Envy?&rdquo; Grace stared in unbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not? Think of the things you
may find. Diamonds perhaps; stocks and
bonds; rare old coins and rarer old books; ancient
silver plate. Just think of the things people
pack away in their trunks! Letters; diaries;
quaint old pictures. It&mdash;why it&rsquo;s like
a trip around the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&mdash;it seems so unfair,&rdquo; Grace wavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the one that&rsquo;s being unfair,&rdquo;
the bright-eyed one reasoned. &ldquo;Those people
can&rsquo;t have their things in those trunks. Perhaps
they are dead. In some cases they lost
their trunks because they were too poor to pay
storage or express charges. You can&rsquo;t well
help that. So why think about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Grace Krowl <i>was</i> to think about it many
times and in the end to do something about
it. That something was to draw her into a
great deal of trouble. For the moment she
left the little secondhand bookshop soothed,
comforted, and filled with a desire to call
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt you think Maxwell Street a terrible
place,&rdquo; the smiling girl said as she walked
with her to the door, &ldquo;and that your uncle&rsquo;s
store is the worst on the street. But I could
tell you&mdash;&rdquo; A shadow fell across her face. &ldquo;I
could tell you things about grand stores on
a very grand street in this city of ours. Per&mdash;perhaps
I will sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace was startled as she looked into her
face. It had suddenly become gray and old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange,&rdquo; she murmured as, dodging
a pushcart laden with geese, she hurried away
toward Nicholas Fischer&rsquo;s place on Maxwell
Street. &ldquo;How strange. And how&mdash;how sort
of terrible. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>The words of a great man came to her. &ldquo;No
situation in life is ever so bad but that it might
be worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; you may be asking by this time,
&ldquo;have the adventures of a girl from Kansas to
do with Johnny Thompson and his friends?&rdquo;
The answer is: &ldquo;A great deal.&rdquo; In the first
place, Drew Lane, having discovered this little
lady while traveling in a bus, was not the
sort to desert her in her plight. In the second
place, an invisible finger of light moving across
the sky was destined to join the fates of Johnny
Thompson and Grace Krowl.</p>
<p>However, for the time, we will return to
Johnny and his friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />THE UNHOLY FIVE</h2>
<p>During the course of their conversation
about the open fire in Drew Lane&rsquo;s
shack, Captain Burns took from his inside
pocket a small package which proved to be
five photographs pasted securely upon a strip
of stout cloth in such a manner that they might
be folded together in the form of a small book.
&ldquo;Ever see any of these?&rdquo; he said to Johnny
after spreading them out upon his knee.</p>
<p>For a moment Johnny studied the pictures
thoughtfully. Then he gave a sudden start.
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he exclaimed, pointing a trembling
finger at the third in the row, &ldquo;is the man who
sat beside me in the auction&mdash;who got me to
bid in that package!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; The Captain&rsquo;s tone was
tense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be a doubt about it. See that scar like
a cross? Couldn&rsquo;t well miss that, could I?
He&rsquo;s the one all right. And, though I could
never prove it, I&rsquo;d swear he was the one who
struck me from the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, by all that&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; Johnny sprang
to his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get that man! See if I don&rsquo;t!
No man can strike me from the shadows and
get away with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess that makes your friend
Johnny here one of us. That right, Drew?&rdquo;
the Captain rumbled.</p>
<p>Drew Lane nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, son,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
you what those pictures mean. Drew here and
Tom Howe carry those pictures with them always.
So does Joyce, though I don&rsquo;t know
quite where&mdash;in her stocking perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joyce smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We joke at times,&rdquo; the Captain went on,
&ldquo;but this affair is no joke. Those men are our
assignment. They are to be our assignment
until every man of them is behind bars or in
his grave. You may join us if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice was low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>The Captain extended his hand as a solemn
pledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a right to know,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;just what men you are after, and what they
have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are hardened criminals, every one,
public enemies of the worst sort. A little more
than a month ago they sealed their fate&mdash;they
killed a policeman, the finest copper that ever
walked a beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time the Captain stared at the fire.
&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; he said at last, in a different voice,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take you with me somewhere,
sometime. The finest little family you ever
saw!&rdquo; he rumbled low as if talking to himself.</p>
<p>Then, with a sudden start, he repeated,
&ldquo;They killed a policeman. Of course a policeman&rsquo;s
no better than any other man. But with
us there&rsquo;s an unwritten law that no officer shall
go unavenged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t all they did, this unholy five.
They went to a banker&rsquo;s home at midnight and
terrorized his family until morning. Man&rsquo;s
wife was in ill health. But of course&mdash;&rdquo; The
Captain&rsquo;s voice rumbled with scorn and hate.
&ldquo;Of course you couldn&rsquo;t expect these robbers
to take note of a little thing like that! What
do they care for women and children?</p>
<p>&ldquo;When morning came they took the man to
his bank. They compelled him to open the
vault. They took the bank&rsquo;s securities, more
than two hundred thousand dollars worth.
Then, of course, they went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By some oversight, the bank&rsquo;s insurance
had been allowed to lapse. Because of this
heavy loss the bank was forced to close its
doors. It was a working man&rsquo;s bank. Thousands
of common folks lost their savings.
These five men&mdash;no doubt they had a fine time
with the currency they took!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the bonds&mdash;&rdquo; His voice rose again.
&ldquo;The bonds are hot. We&rsquo;ve kept them hot.
They dare not sell them. And we&rsquo;ll get them
back yet, see if we don&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those are the men we&rsquo;re after!&rdquo; he
added a moment later. &ldquo;Are you still with
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than ever!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice was husky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Once again the Captain offered his hand.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lad after my own heart,&rdquo; he rumbled.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve two places I want to show you, and
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll like them both.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />DOWN A BEAM OF LIGHT</h2>
<p>Grace Krowl, the girl from Kansas,
found plenty of things to occupy her
thoughts as she sank into a chair in one of the
two small rooms allotted to her on the upper
floor of her uncle&rsquo;s store in Chicago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A store in Chicago.&rdquo; She laughed low. Her
uncle&rsquo;s store in Chicago. What dreams had
she not dreamed of this store? Chicago was a
grand city. His store must be a grand place.
She had of late pictured it as a six-story building;
pure fancy, for he had never written about
its size or importance. In fact, he had not
written at all until she had written first and
asked for a position as clerk in his store. He
had been married to her mother&rsquo;s sister. The
sister was dead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>When Grace had needed work badly she had
written, and he had replied briefly: &ldquo;I can give
you work at fifteen dollars per week and
board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here she was. And her uncle&rsquo;s store was
little more than a hole in the wall. No counters,
no glass cases. Things piled in heaps, and
all secondhand; glass dishes here, bed covers
there, dresses, sheets, towels, everything. And
in the corner, like so many skeletons, a great
pile of bruised, battered and empty trunks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He buys trunks, other people&rsquo;s trunks.&rdquo;
She shuddered afresh.</p>
<p>Then the words of her new-found friend of
the bookstore came to her. &ldquo;Diamonds, stocks
and bonds.&rdquo; These were dreams. &ldquo;But rare
old books, wonderful bits of Irish lace, why
not?&rdquo; Perhaps, after all, she could drive away
the ache that came in her throat at the thought
that someone who truly loved these things had
lost them because they were poor.</p>
<p>She thought of her own trunk and laughed
aloud. What a sight that must have been&mdash;she
snatching at her prized possessions and
those other women poking her and banging
her on the head!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Of course it had all been a mistake. She had
come to Chicago by bus and had sent on her
trunk by express. The van that went for her
trunk had also picked up a half dozen others
which her uncle had bought at auction. The
trunks had become mixed. The lock had been
pried off her own and the contents were being
sold when she arrived. Everything had been
retrieved except a pearl-backed brush she
prized and a hideous vase she abhorred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That did not turn out so badly,&rdquo; she assured
herself. &ldquo;Perhaps everything will come
along quite as well.&rdquo; And yet, as she took a
handful of silver coins and one paper dollar
from her purse and added them up, her face
was very sober. She was a long way from
home, and there could be no retreat.</p>
<p>The place she was to call home was above
the store. Too tired and preoccupied to notice
at first, she received a shock when she at last
became conscious of her surroundings. The
room in which she sat was a tiny parlor, all
her own. Off from that was a bedroom.
Everything&mdash;&#8203;furniture, rugs, decorations,&mdash;&#8203;was
in exquisite taste and perfect harmony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Contrast!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Who could ask
for greater contrast? Rags below, and this
above!&rdquo; She stared in speechless surprise.</p>
<p>One thing astonished her. Opposite the
window in the parlor was an oval, concave
mirror, like an old-fashioned light reflector. It
was some two feet across.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why it is here,&rdquo; she murmured.
She was to wonder more as the days passed.</p>
<p>When she had prepared herself for the
night&rsquo;s rest, she snapped out the light, then
stood for a brief time at the open window
looking out into the night. She was on the
second floor of her uncle&rsquo;s small building. Before
her were the low, flat roofs of some one-story
shacks. Looking far beyond these, she
saw squares of light against the night sky.
These she knew were lighted windows of distant
skyscrapers. There were thousands of
these windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can they all do at night?&rdquo; she asked
herself. &ldquo;Struggling to make money, to get
on, to keep their families housed and fed,&rdquo; the
answer came to her. Then, strangely enough,
her mind carried her back over the trail that
had brought her to this city. It had been an
interesting adventure, that long bus ride. Six
of the passengers, including herself, had ridden
hundreds of miles together. They had become
like a little community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was as if these were pioneer days,&rdquo; she
told herself now. &ldquo;As if we were journeying
in covered wagons in a strange new land.&rdquo;
One of these long distance passengers, as you
will know, had been a young man. In his golf
knickers and soft, gray cap, he had seemed a
college boy. But he was not. &ldquo;Out of college
and at work,&rdquo; was the way he had expressed
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What work do you do?&rdquo; she had asked.</p>
<p>He had hesitated before replying. Then his
answer had been vague. &ldquo;Oh, I just look after
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look after people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of people. All sorts.&rdquo; A queer smile
had played about the corners of his mouth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>She had not pressed the question further.
But now, standing there looking out into his
city at night, she whispered, &ldquo;His name was
Drew Lane. Wonder if I&rsquo;ll ever see him again?
I hope so. He seemed a nice boy, and I should
love to know how he looks after &lsquo;lots of people&mdash;all
sorts.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked again at the many lighted
windows. Suddenly those who toiled there
seemed very near to her. She found a strange
comfort in this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too, must do my best,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;God help me to be wise and strong, helpful
to others and kind to all!&rdquo; she prayed as she
gave herself over to sleep.</p>
<p>She was wakened at dawn by a whisper. At
first, so closely did dream life blend with the
life of day, it seemed natural that she should
be listening to this whisper. When she had
come into full consciousness she sprang out of
bed with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; The words came in slowly,
a distinct whisper. &ldquo;We hope you are happy
this morning. Cheerio! That&rsquo;s the word!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When you have dressed,&rdquo; the whisper continued,
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t you just step out into the little
parlor and take a seat by the table? It will be
good to have a look at your shining face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone in my little parlor! I don&rsquo;t like
it. And that whisper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dressed hurriedly, then stepped through
the door. What sort of person had she expected
to see? Probably she could not have
told. What she did see was <i>an empty room</i>.</p>
<p>Greatly astonished, hardly knowing why she
obeyed the whispered orders, she took a seat
by the table. Instantly the whisper began once
more:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! There you are! I am talking to you
over a beam of light. I am a mile away. I have
interesting things to tell you. You are going
to aid me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a brief space of time the whisper ended.
The girl&rsquo;s mind was in a whirl. &ldquo;Talking down
a beam of light!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;What nonsense!
Going to aid that whisperer?&rdquo; Here
surely was some strange mystery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />CUT ADRIFT</h2>
<p>For some time Grace Krowl remained at
her small table awaiting some further message
from the mysterious whisperer. No further
message came. Had this whisper told the
truth? Was he a mile away? She could not
believe it.</p>
<p>On descending to the floor below, she found
her strange uncle prepared to leave his odd
store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today I go to an auction,&rdquo; he said to her
with a smile. &ldquo;Today there is nothing to unpack.
Not many people will come. They come
only when there are trunks. Tomorrow there
will be trunks, perhaps many trunks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trunks,&rdquo; Grace thought with an involuntary
shudder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Today,&rdquo; her uncle went on, &ldquo;Margot will
tend store.&rdquo; He nodded toward an aged woman
bending over a pile of soiled garments. &ldquo;Today
you are free. You may make yourself at
home in your new place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that day in her little parlor, Grace had
one ear open for the Whisperer. She heard
nothing. He spoke, apparently, only at dawn.
The day was, for her, quite uneventful.</p>
<p>The same could not be said for our young
friend Johnny. Late that day, with a narrow
bandage still about his head, he returned to
the &ldquo;House of Magic.&rdquo; And, almost at once,
adventure struck him squarely between the
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are just in time!&rdquo; Felix, the inventor&rsquo;s
son, greeted him. &ldquo;I have not tried that new
thing. We will begin at dusk, in an hour or
two in a captive balloon,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A captive balloon!&rdquo; Johnny felt a thrill
course up his spine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the Fair grounds,&rdquo; Felix added. &ldquo;There
is one over there. The grounds are deserted.
I have permission to use the balloon. I have
had it inflated. No one will bother us there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>It is better sometimes to do things where
there are crowds. Felix was to learn this.
There is safety in numbers.</p>
<p>At the gate of the deserted Fair grounds Felix
presented his pass. They were admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sent the equipment over in a small truck,&rdquo;
he explained to Johnny. &ldquo;Rather heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What equipment?&rdquo; The words were on
Johnny&rsquo;s tongue. He did not say them. Just in
time he recollected that he was to look, listen,
help all he could and not ask questions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be told all I need to know in good time,&rdquo; he
assured himself. Had he but known it, that
night he was to need wisdom not written in
any book.</p>
<p>The streets they were passing through now
were strange. The falling darkness gave to everything
an air of mystery. Here some great
man-made dragon opened its mouth as if to
swallow them, there a tattered sign fluttered
and cracked in the wind. &ldquo;The great Century
of Progress!&rdquo; Johnny whispered. &ldquo;Here thousands
swarmed along the Midway. Now all is
still. Now&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; He stopped dead in his
tracks. Had he caught the sound of scurrying
feet? Yes, he was sure of it. And there, well
defined against a wall, were the shadows of
two half crouching figures. One was tall, the
other short. Johnny felt a chill run up his spine.</p>
<p>Felix apparently had seen nothing, heard
nothing. He had gone plodding stolidly on
into the gathering darkness; was at this moment
all but lost from sight.</p>
<p>With a little cry of consternation, Johnny
sprang after him.</p>
<p>By the time he caught up to him they were
at the spot where the balloon was kept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just release this clutch when we are
ready to go up,&rdquo; Felix explained, &ldquo;then up we
go. There is a time arrangement that will set
the electrically operated drum, winding us
back down again in two hours. We only go
up about three hundred feet. Cable holds us.
Quite safe tonight, no wind to speak of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny thought this a rather strange arrangement.
&ldquo;No guard here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need. No one&rsquo;s allowed in the grounds
unless they have a pass. Climb in. All set.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Johnny did climb in, and up they went.</p>
<p>Johnny had been in the air many times. For
all that, he experienced a strange sense of insecurity
as they rose a hundred, two hundred,
three hundred feet into the murky air of night.
&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a low breath. &ldquo;It is
nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That he might throw off this feeling of
dread, he busied himself with other thoughts.
His gaze swept the city where lights were
gleaming. &ldquo;Where,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;are Drew
and Tom? Hunting pickpockets perhaps. And
where is Captain Burns? I&rsquo;m going to like
him, I&rsquo;m sure. He is so solid and real; but
jovial for all that. He said he&rsquo;d take me places.
What places? I wonder. Dangerous places?
He said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts were broken in upon by Felix&rsquo;s
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are at the top. Now for the test.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>The young inventor flashed on a powerful
searchlight. &ldquo;All I have to do is to connect
this through a switch, aim my light at a window
in our house, take up this microphone and
say, &lsquo;Hello father!&rsquo; He hears me and no one
else in the world can. He&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed in consternation.
&ldquo;The current is off. Someone cut the light
cable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone was sober.
He was looking over the side of the balloon
basket in which they rode. &ldquo;The cable that
holds us has been cut! We&rsquo;re drifting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; Consternation sounded in
the older boy&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going out into
the night, over black waters. And there is no
ballast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got us, those two!&rdquo; Johnny muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What two?&rdquo; Felix demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw them on the grounds, a tall one and
a short one&mdash;anyway I saw their shadows.
Should have told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Felix groaned. &ldquo;Wonder what we&rsquo;ve
done to them. But they haven&rsquo;t got us&mdash;not
yet!&rdquo; There was courage and high resolve in
Felix Van Loon&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll beat them yet.
You&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would they? Johnny silently wondered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Strangely enough, at that moment thoughts
not related at all to this adventure passed
through his mind. He was once more in that
place of mystery, the professor&rsquo;s house, in the
hallway seeing eyes in the wall, shuddering at
sight of his own skeleton. &ldquo;How could all that
have happened?&rdquo; he asked himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />A RUNAWAY CAPTURED</h2>
<p>Johnny had known a thrill or two, but
none quite like drifting through the night
in a balloon that was not meant for drifting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not an ounce of ballast!&rdquo; Felix groaned.
&ldquo;And the night so dark we may plunge without
a moment&rsquo;s notice into those cold, black
waters. And then&mdash;oh well, what&rsquo;s the good
of thinking about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There truly was no use at all of thinking
about it. If worse came to worst and they
were able to tell the moment of great danger,
they might throw his instruments and the
searchlight over to lighten the balloon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this equipment,&rdquo; Felix moaned, &ldquo;cost
plenty of money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of their predicament, Johnny found
himself wondering about that equipment and
what they had been about to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>For a time Johnny was silent. Then of a
sudden he exclaimed, &ldquo;Felix, we are drifting
northeast! That means we&rsquo;ll be over the lake
for hours. If the wind rises, if a strong gust
drags us down, or if the gas bag leaks and we
are plunged into the lake we are lost! A three
hundred foot cable hangs beneath this balloon.
It is weighting us down. Suppose we could cut
it away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an idea!&rdquo; Felix was all alert. &ldquo;But it
hangs from below. How&rsquo;ll you reach it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a rope. I&rsquo;ll go over the side. You
hang on to the rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Felix slowly, &ldquo;will be taking a
long chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whole thing&rsquo;s a chance.&rdquo; Johnny was tying
a loop in the rope. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll put a foot in
this loop, hold to the rope with one hand and
work with the other. Flashlight will tell me
all I need to know. Can hold the light in my
teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should be in a circus.&rdquo; Felix laughed.
For all that, he made the other end of the rope
fast, then prepared to lower his companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>As he climbed up and over, Johnny felt his
heart miss a beat. It was strange, this crawling
out into space. All was dark below. Was
the water a hundred or a thousand feet down?
He could not tell. The majestic Lindbergh
light swept the sky, but its rays did not touch
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only it did,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;someone
would see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, at this very moment the
professor&rsquo;s golden-haired daughter, Beth, was
making strenuous efforts to bring that very
thing to pass, to get one of those eyes of the
night, a powerful searchlight, focussed upon
the runaway balloon.</p>
<p>Her father, sensing that something had gone
wrong with the balloon, had hurried her away
to the spot from which the balloon had risen.
Arrived there after a wild taxi ride, she had
discovered on the instant what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some&mdash;someone cut the cable with an electric
torch!&rdquo; In vain her eyes searched the sky
for the balloon. She was about to hurry away
when a hand gripped her arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where would you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking one look at the man, she sent forth
an involuntary scream. She had seen that man
before. He carried a knife in his sleeve. She
was terribly afraid.</p>
<p>Her scream had electrifying results. A huge
bulk of a youth with tangled red hair emerged
from somewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you!&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;Let her go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Releasing the girl, the small dark man
sprang at her protector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; the girl screamed. &ldquo;He&mdash;he has
a knife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her warning was not needed. The little
man&rsquo;s knife went coursing through the air.
Next instant the little man followed it into the
dark. The big fellow&rsquo;s fists had done all this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, sister,&rdquo; the young giant turned to
Beth, &ldquo;where was it you wanted to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the Skidmore Building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Skidmore? O.K.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>Fairly picking her up, he rushed her to the
taxi that was waiting for her, then climbed in
beside her. &ldquo;Skidmore Building. Make it
snappy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once in the taxi and speeding away, Beth
was able to collect her thoughts. There was,
at the top of the tall Skidmore Building, a
searchlight. This was not always in operation,
but was held in readiness for any emergency
either on the water or in the air. If only she
could get that light searching the air for the
runaway balloon something, she felt sure,
could be done about it.</p>
<p>The taxi came to a sudden jarring halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; She dropped a half dollar in the
taxi driver&rsquo;s hand. At the same instant something
was pressed into the palm of her left
hand. She looked up. Her powerful young
protector was gone. In her hand was a card.</p>
<p>A moment later as she shot toward the stars
in an elevator she looked at that card and
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gunderson Shotts, 22 Diversey Way&rdquo; it
read. And in the lower right hand corner,
&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s Business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>She smiled in spite of herself as she murmured,
&ldquo;Gunderson Shotts, Everybody&rsquo;s Business.
What a strange calling!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>At that same moment Johnny was going
over the side into the dark. It was strange,
this adventure. &ldquo;Must be careful,&rdquo; he told himself.
And indeed he must. Dark waters awaited
him. A drop from that height would probably
kill or at least maim him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>The bright lights of the city called to him
from afar. He had seen much of that bright
and terrible city; had meant to see much more.
&ldquo;Must see it all,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now I must forget it,&rdquo; he resolved.</p>
<p>And surely he must, for now he was beneath
the basket. The tiny finger of light from his
electric torch shot about here and there.</p>
<p>Steadying its motion, directing it toward the
end of the cable, he began studying the problem
at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>And then&mdash;something happened. Did his
hand slip? Did the noose about his foot give
away? He will never know. Nor will he forget
that instant when his flashlight, slipping
from his chattering teeth, shot downward and
he, by the merest chance, escaped following it.</p>
<p>How it happened he will never be able to tell.
This much he knew: he hung there in all that
blackness supporting his weight by one desperately
gripping hand.</p>
<p>Somewhere below was the noose that should
offer him footing. Somewhere far, far below
were black waters waiting. And through his
mind there flashed a thousand pictures of the
bright and beautiful world he might, in ten
seconds&rsquo; time, leave behind.</p>
<p>All this in the space of a split second, then
groping madly, he found the rope with his
other hand. After that began the heart-breaking
task of groping in the dark with his foot
for the dangling rope loop, while the muscles
in his arms became burning bands of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must win!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny! Johnny Thompson!&rdquo; came from
above. &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m dangling. Dra&mdash;draw
me up if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Came a sudden tug on the rope that all but
tore the rope from his grip. &ldquo;No! No! Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again he sought that noose with his
toe.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>As for Beth, she had gone shooting up in
that express elevator in the Skidmore Building.</p>
<p>Like a rubber ball she bounded from the car,
then raced for a cubby-hole in a corner where
two men were standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The balloon!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;The captive
balloon! It&rsquo;s loose, drifting! You must find it
with your light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; one man demanded sharply.
&ldquo;Impossible! There&rsquo;s no gale. That cable
couldn&rsquo;t break!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s loose! Drifting!&rdquo; the girl insisted.
&ldquo;They cut the cable, someone cut it. My
brother and another boy are in the balloon.
You must save them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One man glanced at the other. &ldquo;All right,
we better try it, Ben!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>At that a long finger of white light began
feeling its way through the blackness that is
sky above Lake Michigan on a cloudy night.</p>
<p>Johnny, unable to find the loop in the rope,
feeling his strength unequal to a climb hand
over hand, felt the muscles of his arms weaken
until all seemed lost.</p>
<p>And then, as if some miracle had been done,
night turned into day. The powerful light had
reached him only for a second, but that was
enough. His keen eye had caught the loop in
the rope. It was by his knee. A sudden fling
and his knee was resting in that loop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&mdash;all right now!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Try to pull
me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at that the gleam of that powerful
searchlight returned to rest on the spot of air
in which the runaway balloon hung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll step over and call the sausage balloon,
Ben,&rdquo; one of the men in the great steel tower
said to the other as Beth, at sight of the balloon
still drifting high, began breathing more
easily. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to go to the rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>One more fierce struggle and Johnny tumbled
over the side into the balloon&rsquo;s basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s put on with steel rings,&rdquo; he panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;what is?&rdquo; Felix stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cable. What did you think?&rdquo; Johnny
laughed in spite of himself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I
went over to see about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Felix grinned. &ldquo;But now they&rsquo;ve
found us. All the honest people in that great
city will want to save us. Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful
when you think of it?&rdquo; he marveled. &ldquo;So many
good people in the world! So many willing to
give a fellow a lift when he&rsquo;s in trouble. If
only we could all pull together all the time,
what a world this would be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, each occupied with his own
thoughts, they drifted on into the night.</p>
<p>A half hour later a dark bulk came stealing
toward them. This was a small dirigible balloon
owned by an advertising firm. Soon they
were alongside. Instruments were taken
aboard, the runaway balloon deflated, then
they went gliding back toward the city of a
million lights.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Should have had this old sausage in the beginning,&rdquo;
Felix grumbled. &ldquo;Will next time
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny wondered if he would be invited to
participate in that next endeavor and, if so,
what he would learn.</p>
<p>In due time they were back on good solid
earth. But the day, for Johnny, was not yet over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />A ROOM OF STRANGE MAGIC</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; Felix exclaimed as they boarded
a car bound for home. &ldquo;Wonder how it
happened that searchlight fellow was looking
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody told him,&rdquo; Johnny suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I know who!&rdquo; The young inventor&rsquo;s
face fairly shone. &ldquo;It was Beth; couldn&rsquo;t
have been anyone else. Fellow without a sister
is just square out of luck, that&rsquo;s all. The way
she gets me out of things! Say, man! It&rsquo;s
great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later, over cups of steaming
chocolate produced, as before, by the mysterious
&ldquo;Eye,&rdquo; Beth told her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gunderson Shotts,&rdquo; Felix murmured, examining
the card Beth handed him. &ldquo;&lsquo;Everybody&rsquo;s
Business.&rsquo; Suppose that means he tends
to everybody&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Got quite a job on his hands,&rdquo; Johnny
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s big enough to take a huge load of it
on his shoulders.&rdquo; Beth was staring into space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to look him up and thank him,&rdquo; Felix
drawled. Already the events of the day
were fading from his memory. He was dreaming
of some strange new contraption that
might startle the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay with us tonight.&rdquo; Roused from
his revery, he turned to Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sure you will. Show you the room
right away. It&rsquo;s on the third floor; a little
strange, you may find it, but comfortable, extra
fine, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo; Felix favored him with a
smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>The room they entered a few moments later
was strange in two particulars. It was extremely
tall. Johnny thought it must be fully
twenty feet to the ceiling. &ldquo;Queer way to build
a room,&rdquo; was his mental comment. Like other
rooms in the house, it was illuminated to the
deepest corners; yet there were no lamps anywhere.
&ldquo;Odd place, this,&rdquo; he thought. Yet Felix
had warned him. He had been given ample
opportunity to say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the looks of
it.&rdquo; Now he shrugged his shoulders and asked
no questions; that was Johnny&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light begins to fade in twenty minutes,&rdquo;
was Felix&rsquo;s only comment as he left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light begins to fade,&rdquo; Johnny grinned
when the door had been closed. &ldquo;Sure is a
queer way to put it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later he began to realize
that the strange boy had spoken the exact
truth. The light did begin to fade. At first
the change was almost imperceptible, a mere
deepening of shadows in remote corners. Then,
little by little, the pictures that hung low on
those tall walls began to fade. The windows
too, short, low windows, too short, Johnny
thought, for so tall a room, began letting in
light about the shades, a very little light, but
light all the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Breaking the spell that had settled upon his
drowsy senses, Johnny sprang to his feet,
threw off his clothes, dragged on his sleeping
garments, then crept beneath the covers of a
most comfortable bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light is fading,&rdquo; he murmured. He recalled
the lights on the stage of the opera
house. They had not blinked on and off. They
faded like the coming of darkness on the broad
prairies. &ldquo;Sort of nice, I think,&rdquo; he murmured
sleepily. &ldquo;More natural. Like&mdash;like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, after all, what did it matter what it
was like. He had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>How long we have slept we are seldom able
to tell. At times an hour seems a whole night,
at others four hours is but a dozen ticks of the
clock. Johnny slept. He awoke. And at once
his senses were conscious of some change going
on in his room. He was seized with a foreboding
of impending catastrophe.</p>
<p>At first he was at a complete loss to know
what this change was. There was the room.
The low windows still admitted streaks of
light. The chairs, his bed, the very low chest
of drawers were in their accustomed places.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; He ran a hand across his eyes
as if to clear his vision. And then like a flash
it came to him. That exceedingly tall room
was not so tall now&mdash;or was it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible! How absurd!&rdquo; He sat up, determined
to waken himself from a bad dream.</p>
<p>But the thing was no dream. The ceiling
<i>was</i> lower, fully five feet lower. And&mdash;horror
of horrors!&mdash;it was still moving downward,
lower, lower, still lower.</p>
<p>There was not the slightest sound, yet the
boy seemed to feel the breath of moving air
on his face.</p>
<p>Too astonished and frightened to move, he
sat there while that ceiling marched down over
the pattern of a quite futuristic wall-paper.</p>
<p>When at last questions formed themselves
in his fear-frozen brain they were, &ldquo;How far
will it come? Will the posts of my bed arrest
it? If the bed crashes under the weight, what
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was revolving these questions in
his mind and wondering in a vague sort of way
what chance he had of escaping from one of
those third story windows, he noted with a
start that the ceiling had ceased moving. It
was as if its desire to hide great stretches of
wall paper had, for the time at least, been satisfied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>The ceiling having settled nine feet or more,
Johnny found himself in quite a normal bed
chamber. Windows were the proper height,
pictures correctly hung and furniture matching
it all very well.</p>
<p>He settled back on his bed. It had been a
long day. He would just lie there and keep a
wary eye on that playful ceiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />THE WHISPERER RETURNS</h2>
<p>On the following morning at dawn the
whisper returned to Grace Krowl&rsquo;s little
parlor on Maxwell Street. She had just wakened
and lay on her comfortable bed staring
at the faint tracings of beautiful forms on her
unusual walls, when she heard it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pleasant day to you! Here I am again,
talking to you down a beam of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Springing to her feet, she threw on a dressing
gown and dashed into her parlor. She
would trap the intruder. But she did not. As
before, the room was empty.</p>
<p>She took a seat by her table. &ldquo;Ah! There
you are!&rdquo; There was a glad note in the whisper.
&ldquo;How beautiful is youth!&rdquo; She flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no message of importance for you
today,&rdquo; the whisper went on steadily. &ldquo;But
tomorrow&mdash;who knows?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One request: do not disturb any object in
your room. To do so may destroy the charm.
And, in the end, you would regret it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me assure you I am an honorable person.
I am for the law&mdash;not against it. My motives
are good. You may trust me. And you
may believe me when I tell you I am more than
a mile away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl started. There it was again. &ldquo;More
than a mile away. How could anyone be seen
through a mile of space&mdash;much less send a
whisper over that great distance?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A radio,&rdquo; she thought. A careful search revealed
no sign of a radio. Only one object in
her room was strange, the two foot reflector
against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dawn is passing,&rdquo; came once again in a
whisper. &ldquo;Like the fairies, I must be on my
way. Cheerio, and a good day to you!&rdquo; The
room went suddenly silent. It was silence
such as Grace Krowl had seldom experienced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Strangely enough, at the &ldquo;House of Magic&rdquo;
in quite another section of the city, Johnny
Thompson heard that same whisper. What
was stranger still, the words were not the
same. From this it might surely be learned
that this was, at least, not a radio broadcast.</p>
<p>He had fallen asleep staring at that magic
ceiling that had a way of falling silently. He
awoke at dawn, still staring at that ceiling.
To his vast surprise, he found it now fully
twenty feet above his head. &ldquo;Was that way
when I went to bed,&rdquo; he assured himself.
&ldquo;Must have dreamed it&mdash;must&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off to listen with all his
ears. In a clear, distinct whisper had come a
greeting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Johnny Thompson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good&mdash;good morning,&rdquo; he faltered. He was
conscious of a feeling that he was not heard.
In this he was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are glad you are back in the city, Johnny.
You will tell your friend Drew Lane that
we will soon have a definite message for him&mdash;one
that has to do with his present mission.
We will whisper it to you some day at dawn.
That is your room. You must keep it. No
harm will befall you there. And now, may
your day be a busy and profitable one.&rdquo; The
whisper ended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>We might say that, though Johnny failed
to notice it at that time, there was on the far
side of his room a circular mirror or reflector,
such as we have seen in Grace Krowl&rsquo;s room,
and that his window was open toward the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good day to you.&rdquo; Grace Krowl, the
girl from Kansas, recalled these words, whispered
to her &ldquo;down a beam of light&rdquo; many
times during the trying hours of that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whispers,&rdquo; she repeated to herself, &ldquo;whispers
at dawn. What does it mean? And this
whisperer? Is it a man or a woman? Could
one tell by the quality of tone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Whisperer had given her little intimation
of his purpose. She had been assured that
the purpose was honorable and kind. She had
been requested to leave her room just as it
was. This request had caused her to look at
the strange oval reflector on the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>At times she thought of telling her uncle
all about it. &ldquo;But no,&rdquo; she decided in the end,
&ldquo;this shall be my own small secret. What harm
can come from a whisper? The Whisperer
said that he would return. Well then, let him!&rdquo;
With that, for the time, she set the matter
aside.</p>
<p>After a hasty breakfast served by her uncle&rsquo;s
aged housekeeper, she went down into
the &ldquo;store.&rdquo; &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Her uncle pointed to a
number of trunks standing on end just inside
the door. &ldquo;Yesterday was express auction day.
It comes always on Tuesday. I have bought
these trunks. What is there in them? How
should I know? Probably wrags.&rdquo; Nicholas
Fischer was very German in his speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will be surprised.&rdquo; His faded eyes
brightened. &ldquo;We have very swell customers
on Wednesday. They come from the north
side and from out by the University. They are
curious. They want to see what they can buy
cheap. And they buy, right from the trunks.
You shall see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will be very helpful,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;You are young. They will like a bright face.
You shall wait on them. You will know them
by their fine clothes, fur coats, all that. And
I&mdash;&rdquo; He looked over his cheap garments. &ldquo;I
shall wait on the poor ones, the ones who buy
a few towels or some very poor dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you wait on the fine ladies. Only&mdash;&rdquo;
he held up a finger, &ldquo;always I make the price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An artist looking in upon this bewhiskered,
shabbily dressed keeper of a second-hand store
and his niece all pink and fresh in her spotless
smock, would have found contrast to suit his
taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; Nicholas Fischer spoke again, &ldquo;I
will break open the locks and lift the lids, but
you must not unpack the trunks. Leave that
to the fine ladies. They will tell you they are
&lsquo;exploring.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But supposing they find something truly
valuable&mdash;a&mdash;a diamond or something!&rdquo; Grace
protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they find a diamond, then I drop dead.
What will it matter?&rdquo; Nicholas Fischer
laughed hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you keep watch.&rdquo; His shrewd eyes
gleamed. &ldquo;If you find a diamond, then you and
I will buy us a Christmas present.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; It was the girl&rsquo;s turn to laugh.
&ldquo;Christmas will soon be here. I&rsquo;ll find the diamond,
you&rsquo;ll see, and a few stocks and bonds
for good measure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Stocks and bonds.&rdquo; Seizing a hammer
and chisel, Nicholas Fischer pried off the
lock of a large, round-topped trunk. &ldquo;The
round-topped ones,&rdquo; he commented, &ldquo;they
come from the country. Sometimes there are
very fine wool blankets in these. Then we
make a few dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While her uncle was prying away at the
locks, the girl had an opportunity to study the
trunks that, standing as they did, huddled in
a group and tipped this way and that, reminded
her of a picture she had seen of six very
tipsy men awaiting the police wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trunks,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;are like people.
They have character. There is a big wardrobe&mdash;a
trifle shabby to be sure, but still standing
on its dignity. And there are three canvas
covered ones, huddled together. Never been
anybody in particular and never will be.
There&rsquo;s that one with bright orange stripes
running around it, like a delicate lady. There&rsquo;s
that good solid citizen, oak ribs and stout
metal edges. And there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Having moved a little, she had caught sight
of a tiny brown trunk that appeared to hide
behind the &ldquo;solid citizen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horsehair trunk,&rdquo; she whispered to herself.
&ldquo;Old as the hills. What must it contain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then her uncle, chisel in hand, approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo; Her cry was one almost of pain.
&ldquo;Are there not enough others? This little one
must not have much in it. Let me look at it&mdash;alone
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas Fischer, looking into her pleading
eyes, shook his head. &ldquo;I am afraid you will
wreck my business. You are too soft.&rdquo; Nevertheless,
he spared the little trunk.</p>
<p>Dropping his chisel in the corner, he threw
a ragged blanket over it as he muttered, &ldquo;Tomorrow
will be time enough. But mind you,
it must be tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>The &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; came, just as her uncle had
promised they would. They came dressed in
furs&mdash;mink, marten and Hudson seal&mdash;for it
was a bleak, blustery day. They picked their
way daintily between piles of used bedding and
soiled dresses, to pause at last before the open
trunks.</p>
<p>As they looked into the slim trunk with
orange stripes about it, Grace was reminded
of a picture she had seen of three vultures sitting
on a rock peering into the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snoopers! How I hate them! Yet, I must
serve them.&rdquo; Next moment she was wondering
whether or not she was being quite fair
to them. They had come where things were
sold and had a right to inspect the wares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But everything in that trunk belonged to
a person who treasured it,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Why must such rude hands unpack it, after
it was packed with such care? Why must each
one carry away the one treasure she most desires,
while the rightful owner goes empty-handed?&rdquo;
To this question she could find no
answer save one haunting verse she remembered
from a very old book: &ldquo;The destruction
of the poor is their poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>She summoned a friendly smile and assisted
the &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; in emptying this trunk which had
belonged to a young lady. When, however,
Grace came to a drawer of photographs, letters
and personal papers, she dumped them all
into a card-board box and shoved them under
the ragged quilt where the little horsehair
trunk seemed to peek at her through the holes.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; turned from the next three
trunks in disgust. Two men&rsquo;s, and one family
trunk, they offered little more than dirty rags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why must people be so filthy,&rdquo; a fat &ldquo;lady&rdquo;
in a mink coat complained. &ldquo;If they must lose
their things you&rsquo;d think they might at least
wash them before packing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wardrobe trunk offered gaudy finery
that did not interest the &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; overmuch.
But the big square trunk Grace had named the
&ldquo;substantial citizen&rdquo;&mdash;this one it was that
brought a fresh ache to the girl&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>It turned out to be a household trunk filled
with bedding, linen and all sorts of fancy articles
done by hand. Everything was scrupulously
clean. And the bits of hand embroidery,
the touches of lace, the glints of color all done
with the finest thread, seemed to say, &ldquo;I belong
to a home. We all belong together. We rested
beneath the lamp, above the fireplace in a room
some people called home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to picture that home. There was
a man, a woman, and their children, a brother
and a sister. The man read. The woman&rsquo;s fingers
were busy with thread and needle. The
children played with the cat before the fire.</p>
<p>Her eyes filled with tears as she thought, &ldquo;All
this is being destroyed. All that is best in our
good, brave land, a home, has become a wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the &ldquo;ladies&rdquo;! How they babbled and
screamed. &ldquo;Oh Clara! Look! Isn&rsquo;t this a
scream? Only look at this piece! Isn&rsquo;t it exquisite?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mary, just take a peek at this buffet
runner. Two yards long! And all done by
hand! It&rsquo;s a treasure. I&rsquo;ll offer the old man a
half dollar for it. He&rsquo;ll take it. What does he
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace listened and set her lips tight. Life,
she could see, was going to be hard, but she
would certainly see it through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>She experienced a sense of contentment as
she recalled the little horsehair trunk. Tonight
she would spirit that away up to her room and
there she would find adventure looking inside
it. There would be letters, she told herself, and
photographs&mdash;and&mdash;and perhaps some real
treasure.</p>
<p>At that moment her eyes caught a second
box of keepsakes. These too she shoved away
under the ragged quilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight in my parlor,&rdquo; she told herself.
She was rapidly coming to know that each
trunk told the story of the owner. In her room
she would read that story.</p>
<p>Her parlor. Her brow wrinkled. What a
mysterious room! So perfect, and in such a
place. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the concave mirror, and
the whisper at dawn.&rdquo; She shuddered in spite
of herself.</p>
<p>Then she came out of her revery with a
snap. The fat lady in the mink coat was approaching
her uncle. She would offer half a
dollar for the buffet runner. Gliding swiftly
past, Grace whispered in her uncle&rsquo;s ear:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The price is three dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;lady&rdquo; gave her a suspicious glance.
But the price <i>was</i> three dollars. And in the
end, three dollars the lady paid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all the trunks?&rdquo; The fat lady turned
a petulant, spoiled face toward the girl. &ldquo;Are
there no other trunks?&rdquo; She snatched at the
ragged blanket, but Grace was too quick for
her, her foot was on its edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no other trunks to be opened
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;ah!&rdquo; The &ldquo;lady&rdquo; sighed. &ldquo;This has
been such fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fun? Grace turned away. And in turning
she found herself presenting a tearful face to
none other than Drew Lane her friend of the
bus, who had entered unnoticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he smiled, pretending not to see her
tears. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the big store in Chicago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great! Great!&rdquo; She managed a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how are all the people you look af&mdash;after?&rdquo;
she asked a bit unsteadily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo; He laughed a low
laugh. &ldquo;In fact&mdash;&rdquo; His voice dropped to a
hoarse whisper&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some of them locked
up. Quite a number. You see, I&rsquo;m a city detective.
This is part of my territory. I&rsquo;ll be
seeing you often, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started and stared. That whisper! When
one spoke out loud his voice could be recognized.
She knew this. But a whisper? Could
one truly recognize a whisper when he heard
it the second time? It seemed incredible. And
yet, Drew Lane&rsquo;s whisper was so like the one
she had heard at dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible! A mere fancy!&rdquo; She tried to
free herself from this apparently unreasonable
suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A penny for your thoughts,&rdquo; Drew Lane
bantered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Not for a dollar,&rdquo; was her quick
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll be
seeing you. Got to hurry on down the street.&rdquo;
He was gone, leaving the girl&rsquo;s head in a whirl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whispers at dawn?&rdquo; she murmured as she
made her way toward the horsehair trunk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What about these?&rdquo; She held the box of
keepsakes from the big trunk up for her uncle&rsquo;s
inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These? Letters? Pictures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a wry face. &ldquo;Baby books, maybe.
Who would buy these? Throw them in the
alley. Black children live in the next street.
They carry them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look! Here is the croix de guerre.
Some brave fellow fought to win that,&rdquo; she
protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! But did he keep it? No! Let some
black boy wear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I may keep them? All these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rewarded him with a smile. After the
evening meal she would read the stories recorded
here and she would explore the little
horsehair trunk.</p>

<br />SO LONG AS GOD GIVES US BREATH</h2>
<p>That same morning as soon as he could
gulp down his coffee, Johnny hastened
over to the shack. He was full of talk about
the whisperer and his message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of a thing like that?&rdquo;
he demanded of Captain Burns. &ldquo;It seemed to
come right out of the sky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; The Captain smiled. &ldquo;We
are living in a strange world these days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing&rsquo;s important,&rdquo; he said as he sat
up in his chair, &ldquo;you must not leave this &lsquo;House
of Magic&rsquo; as you call it; at least not for long.
I have a feeling that this whisperer must be
on our side, the side of law and justice, and
that he may be some sort of undercover man
who can give us just the information we need.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Johnny&mdash;&rdquo; He leaned forward in
his chair. &ldquo;That gang, the five public enemies,
with Iggy the Snake at their head, is back in
the city. They are sure, sooner or later, to
sell some of these bonds they took from the
bank. They are of small denominations and
are negotiable. We have their serial numbers.
The moment one of these bonds falls into the
hands of an honest man, we will be hot on
their trail. &lsquo;Where did you get it?&rsquo; we will
say to the honest man. He will tell us. We
will go to the man who sold the bond and repeat,
&lsquo;Where did you get it?&rsquo; He may turn
out to be honest and innocent too. But in the
end we&rsquo;ll reach a crooked bond dealer who
knew those bonds were &lsquo;hot&rsquo; when he bought
them. If he doesn&rsquo;t lead us to Iggy the Snake
we&rsquo;ll send him up for ten years. The charge
will be receiving stolen goods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I tell you, Johnny!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
striking the arm of his chair, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em,
Johnny! In the end we&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em, you&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But today, Johnny&mdash;&rdquo; His voice took on a
mellow tone. &ldquo;While you and I are free, I&rsquo;d
like to take you to one of those places I spoke
of the last time I saw you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All&mdash;all right.&rdquo; Johnny wondered what
sort of place that would be.</p>
<p>In the Captain&rsquo;s long, powerful gray car they
drove across the city and into the suburbs.</p>
<p>At last they stopped before a home that was
neither large nor showy&mdash;a bungalow with its
broad side to the street, it stood in the midst
of a clump of trees. Nature had planted the
trees. Someone, admiring nature&rsquo;s work, had
built his home there.</p>
<p>Once inside that house, the good Captain
heaved a sigh of content. A large open fire
gave the tiny living room a feeling of luxurious
grandeur. And yet there was about it an air
of tidy comfort. The furniture was plain.
Hard-bottomed rockers had been softened by
handmade cushions, all in bright colors. A
touch of lace and embroidery here and there
on table and chairs told of fingers never still.</p>
<p>A short, energetic little lady with flushed
cheeks hastened from the kitchen at the back
to greet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how do you do, Captain Burns? How
good it is to see you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be here,&rdquo; the Captain rumbled.
&ldquo;And this, Mrs. LeClare, is my good friend
Johnny Thompson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here,&rdquo; the Captain chuckled, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
Alice. Ah, Johnny, there&rsquo;s a girl you could
love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny flushed. The girl who extended her
hand laughed a merry laugh. &ldquo;The Captain
must have his jokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hand Johnny grasped was a chubby,
capable little hand; the eyes he looked into
were frank and clear. The girl&rsquo;s hair was
black. There was a slight natural wave in it.
Her eyebrows were black and thick. She was
short like her mother. Like her too, she gave
forth an air of boundless energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alice LeClare,&rdquo; Johnny said, half to himself.
&ldquo;A pretty name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are French,&rdquo; Alice explained, &ldquo;Canadian
French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you looked over the list of Mounties
that have come and gone up in the bleak northland
of Canada, you&rsquo;d find many a LeClare,&rdquo;
the Captain explained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Johnny saw a shadow pass over Mrs. LeClare&rsquo;s
face. Alice looked quickly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to excuse us,&rdquo; Mrs. LeClare
explained after a moment of silence. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
in the midst of things. Make yourselves comfortable
by the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just what sort of things the ladies were in
the midst of, Johnny could guess well enough.
The kitchen was not too far away&mdash;one great
advantage of a small house&mdash;and from it came
savory odors, meat roasting, pumpkin pies
baking, apple sauce simmering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can cook,&rdquo; said the Captain, dropping
into a chair with the air of a contented dog.
&ldquo;These Canadian French can cook. And what
workers they are, these people!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys will be here soon,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;Madame LeClare&rsquo;s boys. They&rsquo;re out selling
their magazines. Fine boys&mdash;poor old Jack&rsquo;s
boys.&rdquo; His voice dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Jack?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo; The Captain
sat up. &ldquo;But of course I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not Jack&rsquo;s boys any more,&rdquo; he
rumbled after a moment. &ldquo;Poor old Jack is
dead. Finest, squarest cop that ever walked
a beat. Real name was Jacques&mdash;French you
know. We called him Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish you could have known him, Johnny.
You&rsquo;d have loved him.&rdquo; He stared at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, big, strapping fellow,&rdquo; he went on
after a while. &ldquo;Six feet two, black hair and
bushy eyebrows, like Alice, you know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women used to try to flirt with him. Stop
their car, they would,&mdash;rich women in big cars,
diamonds on their fingers. New-rich, young,
fool women. No good&mdash;you know the kind?
Well, maybe not. You will though. May God
hasten the time when that sort get back to
the dirty gutter where they belong!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jack&mdash;&rdquo; The Captain laughed scornfully.
&ldquo;No danger! Jack sent them along fast
enough. Jack had eyes for one and only one&mdash;his
Marie.&rdquo; He nodded toward the kitchen.
&ldquo;He lived for her, Jack did, and for Alice and
the boys&mdash;fine boys, Gluck and Lucian&mdash;&rdquo; His
voice trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&mdash;what happened to Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Not seeming to hear, the Captain went on:
&ldquo;Straightest cop I ever knew&mdash;too straight you
might say. When you walk a beat you look
after things&mdash;naturally, that&rsquo;s part of your job.
You try store doors to see if they&rsquo;re locked,
watch for prowlers, all that. And if some good
citizen drinks a bit too much and the night
air gets the best of him, you escort him safely
home&mdash;part of your job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grateful people, will hand a cop a dollar
now and then. Why not? But do you think
Jack would take it? Never a cent. No end
polite the way he thanked them, but he took
no money but what came to him on pay day.
That was Jack. Said he was afraid it would
lead him to accept &lsquo;dirty money&rsquo;&mdash;you know,
hush money&mdash;from real wrongdoers. And,
man! How Jack hated dirty money!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polite, honest to a fault, kind, always looking
out after the unfortunate&mdash;and brave, absolutely
fearless!&mdash;&lsquo;Mountie&rsquo; blood in his veins,
way back. That was Jack.&rdquo; Again his voice
trailed away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>From the kitchen came the faintest snatch
of some French song. The delicious aroma of
coffee was added to that of meat, pie and
sauce. From somewhere in the back came the
scuffle and scrape of boyish feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this was Jack&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the Captain rumbled,
spreading his arms wide as if to embrace the
whole world. &ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo; from his pocket
he drew a narrow packet. This he unfolded,
then spread it down the length of his knee.
It was the photographs of public enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These five&mdash;&rdquo; his eyes shone with deep,
abiding hate. &ldquo;These five had been out riding
in a costly car they had borrowed without
leave. They had just kidnapped a banker and
compelled him to open a safe. I told you that
before. They&rsquo;d got a lot of money and bonds.
They were speeding west and tried to pass a
stop-light. They skidded into another car.
No real damage done. But that was Jack&rsquo;s
corner. He wanted to know&mdash;his business to
know&mdash;why they&rsquo;d crashed the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All he said was, &lsquo;What the&mdash;&rsquo; Then, without
an instant&rsquo;s warning, they let him have it
from the back seat&mdash;six shots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then they sped on. Jack, the squarest
cop that ever breathed, was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny&mdash;&rdquo; The Captain&rsquo;s voice was deep.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever for a moment think crime is romantic.
It is not. It is dirty, rotten, selfish,
beastly!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might think to see one of these young
crooks, dressed like &lsquo;Boul Mich&rsquo; on parade,
standing before the judge, that he was just a
young adventurer. He&rsquo;s not. He&rsquo;s a dirty dog.
He&rsquo;s never worked; never will. He sticks a
gun in a working man&rsquo;s ribs and takes his
money. Spends it for flashy clothes, furs and
diamonds for his Moll&mdash;booze maybe, and
gambling. And does he stop to ask, &lsquo;was this
a rich or a poor man&rsquo;s money?&rsquo; You better
know he don&rsquo;t. What does it matter to him
whose it was? It is his now. He took it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And they shot him!&rdquo; His voice dropped to
such a solemn pitch that Johnny was reminded
of some words spoken in a church. &ldquo;They
shot him,&rdquo; the Captain repeated slowly, &ldquo;one
of these five crooks, maybe Iggy the Snake
shot poor old Jack. And by the Eternal!&rdquo; He
stood up, raising his hands high. &ldquo;So long as
God gives us breath, we&rsquo;ll hunt those men until
the last one of them is dead or in jail for
life. For life!&rdquo; His hands dropped to his side
and he sank into his chair.</p>
<p>Then again Johnny was conscious of the
low humming song, the aroma of fine food prepared
by skillful hands and loving hearts&mdash;the
distant scuffle of boyish feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as God gives us breath,&rdquo; he murmured
low. It was like a sacred vow taken by
some knight of King Arthur&rsquo;s court.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />A HUMAN SPIDER</h2>
<p>It was a wonderful dinner they enjoyed in
Madame LeClare&rsquo;s snug little home. And
not the least of the joys for the Captain on that
occasion&mdash;Johnny was sure of this&mdash;were the
smiling eyes of the kindly hostess. As for
Johnny, he had more than one smile from another
pair of dark eyes.</p>
<p>Dinner over, they sat about the fire while
Lucian, a slender boy of twelve, entertained
them with quaint French melodies played upon
an ancient violin that had been his grandfather&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to be a musician,&rdquo; Johnny said to
Lucian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will you be?&rdquo; He turned to
Gluck, a sturdy boy of ten with flashing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him, Gluck.&rdquo; There was pride in the
mother&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to be an officer of the law, like
my father.&rdquo; Gluck squared his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the boy!&rdquo; his mother applauded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a woman for you!&rdquo; the Captain
murmured. His eyes glistened. &ldquo;Gave her husband
for our country&rsquo;s good. Now she offers
her son. This country needs more mothers
such as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was mid-afternoon when they bade Madame
LeClare and her fine family a hearty
farewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted you to know them,&rdquo; the Captain
rumbled as once more they entered the great
city. &ldquo;You are to be one of us. You may have
an opportunity to be of great service. Danger
and death may threaten you. It will help you
to understand the war we are waging, and
why we must win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Johnny humbly. &ldquo;I am
sure it will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a tough neighborhood,&rdquo; the Captain
said a moment later as they rolled down
a narrow street. &ldquo;&lsquo;Hell&rsquo;s Half Acre,&rsquo; I guess
you might call it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what those young hoodlums are
looking at.&rdquo; He slowed down his car to a
crawl. At the corner of a five story apartment
building a dozen or more of flashily dressed
youths stood staring upward. From time to
time one or the other of them might have been
heard shouting something.</p>
<p>Stopping his car, the Captain stepped out.
Johnny followed.</p>
<p>To their astonishment, they saw clinging to
the bricks of the corner, and near to the very
top of the building, a huge youth with a thick
crop of hair. He was tossing his mane, laughing
and roaring like a gorilla, which he resembled
slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down from there!&rdquo; the Captain thundered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and get me,&rdquo; the youth roared back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down!&rdquo; The Captain threw open his
coat, revealing his star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! All right, I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo; The young
giant&rsquo;s face sobered. The crowd of flashily
dressed youths vanished. At the same time a
square of paper came fluttering to the pavement.
Apparently it had fallen from the climber&rsquo;s
pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Johnny picked it up and read:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Gunderson Shotts,</p>
<p class="t0">22 Diversey Way.</p>
<p class="t0">Everybody&rsquo;s Business.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why that,&rdquo; he said with a start, &ldquo;must be
the young savage with a stout heart who
helped us out of a jam last night. Don&rsquo;t be
too hard on him, Captain.&rdquo; Hastily he outlined
the night&rsquo;s adventure with the runaway balloon,
and the part this youth had played.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be too hard on him,&rdquo; the Captain
promised. &ldquo;In fact I think this may be the
changing point in his career. Stranger things
have happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; he demanded as the
young giant reached the pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gunderson Shotts, that&rsquo;s my name.&rdquo; The
youth grinned broadly. &ldquo;But they call me
Spider. I can climb, climb just anything at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Spider,&rdquo; Johnny thought, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a name that
will stick. Looks like a giant spider, long arms,
long legs, hairy head, big eyes. Spider.&rdquo; He
chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; the Captain demanded
of the one who called himself Spider, &ldquo;that
you&rsquo;re likely to break your neck?&rdquo; He examined
the lay of the bricks that had given the
boy only an overlapping half inch at intervals
of a foot, on which to cling and climb. &ldquo;And
if you fell, you&rsquo;d like as not kill someone else
in that fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They dared me, these&mdash;&rdquo; He looked about
in surprise. &ldquo;Why! Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve blown,&rdquo; the Captain replied dryly.
&ldquo;Hawks go flapping away fast enough when
a hunter comes round a corner. They&rsquo;re a bad
lot, and this is no place for a lad like you.
Hop into the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re not going to take me to the
station!&rdquo; Spider&rsquo;s cheeks paled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Captain laughed, &ldquo;not the station.
Just to a shack we have for a hangout. We eat
there sometimes. Like to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I? Try me!&rdquo; The young giant grinned
at his captors broadly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have much luck minding everybody&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;
the Captain asked as they paused for
a red light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; the big boy chuckled, &ldquo;but
what&rsquo;s a fellow to do? No one would let me
work for him, so I went to work for everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did yourself a good turn once anyway,&rdquo;
said the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain reminded him of his adventure
with Beth Van Loon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; the big boy chuckled, &ldquo;was funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might not have been. That fellow might
have put his knife through your heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The big boy laughed
hoarsely.</p>
<p>They stopped at a delicatessen. Here Captain
Burns purchased half a baked ham, piping
hot, a huge loaf of rye bread and a gallon pot
of coffee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Arrived at the shack, he spread this crude
but wholesome meal out upon the table. He
and Johnny drank coffee but ate little. When
they had finished, save for the dishes, the board
was clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spider,&rdquo; the Captain said, slapping the big
boy on the back, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a fighter, an eater,
and a climber. That&rsquo;s all it takes to make a
first class cop. Stick with me and I&rsquo;ll make
you one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spider stuck. And that, as you will see, is
why certain things came out as they did in
the unwinding of events that were to follow.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was with a guilty feeling that Grace
Krowl that evening began delving into the
personal letters and papers taken from the thin
trunk with orange stripes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as if someone were looking over my
shoulder,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;saying, &lsquo;See here!
Those are my letters! What right have you
to read them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she philosophized, &ldquo;if I am to
help them in any way I must know something
about these people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>So she kept on reading. There were three
bundles of letters and a diary. The more she
read, the more deeply disgusted she became.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not dream there could be such a person
as that girl is!&rdquo; she exclaimed, throwing
the letters back into the box and sliding it
into a corner out of her sight. &ldquo;That girl deserves
nothing. False to her friends who try
to help her, a flirt and a cheat. How&mdash;how
terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time she sat and stared into space.
&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she murmured dejectedly, &ldquo;that
very few of them are worthy of any aid. And
yet, there <i>must</i> be some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took up the box from the big family
trunk. In this she read a beautiful sad story of
a father, mother and two little girls. Their
pictures were all there. So too were the girls&rsquo;
baby books and the father&rsquo;s sharp-shooter&rsquo;s
badge.</p>
<p>The letters told the story of a brave but futile
fight against poverty that had advanced
upon them like a storm in the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They lost their home,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Next they lost their furniture, all those things
that had become dear to them. And now, here,
last of all, is their trunk. The wreck of the
grandest thing God&rsquo;s eyes ever rested upon&mdash;a
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But at least&mdash;&rdquo; She clenched her hands
fiercely. &ldquo;At least they shall have these trophies
back. I shall write to the mother and
offer them to her without charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not in every deserving case?&rdquo; she exclaimed,
springing to her feet and hopping
about the room. Here was a big idea. This
should be a beginning. Perhaps in time she
could arrange to hold the entire contents of
a trunk until the real owner could redeem it.</p>
<p>She fancied her uncle frowning upon this.
&ldquo;But let him frown!&rdquo; she exclaimed belligerently.</p>
<p>The thought was a comforting one. With
it, after a trying day, she soon fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>She was awakened, as on the previous day,
by a whisper at dawn. There was no &ldquo;Good
morning,&rdquo; no &ldquo;Cheerio!&rdquo; this time. Words
came short and quick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have just a moment.&rdquo; Thus the whisper
began. &ldquo;There is a girl,&rdquo; it went on. &ldquo;Her
name is Nida McFay. She works in the bookstore
around the corner on Peoria Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace started. &ldquo;Why! That&rsquo;s the girl I
know!&rdquo; She spoke aloud, then ended abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I see you know her! Fine!&rdquo; The
whisper rose. &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t hear you. Had to
read your lips. For the moment I am deaf.
I am a mile away but I have eyes that see you
and lips that speak to you down a beam of
light. You cannot see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps I <i>have</i> seen you.&rdquo; The thought
popped unbidden into the girl&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen carefully!&rdquo; The whisperer&rsquo;s tone
was insistent. &ldquo;You are to become very well
acquainted with this girl, Nida; so well that
she will tell you her story. And let me assure
you&mdash;she has a story to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must invite her to your room, seat her
by your table, then induce her to tell the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that would be spying!&rdquo; the girl burst
out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing dishonorable. Remember, I promise
this. You like to help people. This is your
chance. You may help many. Good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whisper was gone, leaving the girl in a
daze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must think,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Think
clearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then of a sudden her eyes fell upon the little
horsehair trunk. &ldquo;I forgot to open it! And
uncle said I should have it only for a day.
Just for a day!&rdquo; She was filled with consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will have to give me one more day,&rdquo; she
decided at last. &ldquo;He just must! I can&rsquo;t turn
it over to&mdash;to vandals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one full moment after that she stood in
sober thought. Nida McFay. So that was the
girl&rsquo;s name. She was to win her confidence.
Get her story. Would she do it? Something
told her that she would. But why? Because
the whisper requested. Who was the whisperer?
At that she shook herself free from
these thoughts and went off to breakfast.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />A LIVING PICTURE</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson had always supposed
he loved mysteries. But in the
&ldquo;House of Magic,&rdquo; the old professor&rsquo;s house,
they came so thick and fast, and apparently
without reason, that at times he felt dizzy
in his head and ready enough to run away
from it all.</p>
<p>On the day following the visit to Madame
LeClare&rsquo;s house, he was given a strange commission.
It was Felix who said to him, &ldquo;You
will do us a great favor if you will sit and
watch a certain picture on the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch a picture?&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed. &ldquo;Is
it worth a million dollars? And do you expect
it to be stolen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is worth,&rdquo; Felix said without breaking
into a smile, &ldquo;very little. I even doubt if you
could sell it at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if you watch it long
enough, something may come of it after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something did come of it, you may be sure.
But to Johnny, ever keen for action, this at
first seemed a dull occupation.</p>
<p>The picture was in his own room, the tall
room that during his first night had shown an
inclination to become a short one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be more stupid!&rdquo; he told
himself after a half hour of watching. &ldquo;Picture
isn&rsquo;t even halfway interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was true. Though quite evidently an
oil painting, this canvas within a narrow gilt
frame was very dark. An old Dutch master,
one would say; a suggestion of some cabin in
the foreground, clumps of trees behind. There
might have been a sunset in the beginning.
If there were, time had taken care of the sunset.
It had put out the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to sit in this chair and look at that
picture!&rdquo; he grumbled to himself. &ldquo;Nothing
could be worse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes strayed to the far side of the room
where the strange round reflector rested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whispers,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Those whispers
that wakened me at dawn. Wonder if
they come from that thing? I feel sure they
do. Person can tell what direction sound
comes from. But who whispers? How? Why?
That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to find out.&rdquo; That the
whisperer would speak again, that he would
at last deliver some important message, perhaps
many important messages, he did not
doubt.</p>
<p>But now&mdash; It was with great reluctance
that he dragged his eyes from this mysterious
instrument to fix them once more upon the
dull and quite commonplace Dutch master.</p>
<p>When at last he accomplished the feat, he
fairly bounced from his chair. The Dutch master
was gone! In its stead was a square of
glass. Out from that square, well down toward
the left-hand corner, shone a yellow spot
of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a moon in the midst of a black sky,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;What&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>The spot of light began revolving. It broke
itself up into a hundred yellow moons. It became
a golden circle, a hundred golden circles.
Then, to Johnny&rsquo;s utter astonishment, a face,
a living face appeared in that frame.</p>
<p>It was a wavering sort of face. Had Johnny
been superstitious he might have said it was a
ghost, for now the lips and eyes were distinct,
and now they were irregular and all but
lost.</p>
<p>Then with a sharp cry Johnny sprang to
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I must find him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had recognized that face. It was the
man who sat beside him at the auction, who
had all but forced him to bid in that package
containing the bronze lamp, who had later
more than likely struck him over the head in
that dark alley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iggy the Snake!&rdquo; He fairly shouted the
name aloud.</p>
<p>That this was the living image of Iggy
he could not doubt. He was blinking his eyes.
He was talking to someone; that is, his lips
moved, though no sound reached Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>That this was no mere moving picture
Johnny knew well enough. That Iggy was
not in the next room, looking in at him, he
knew quite as well. Iggy could never have
held the expression of quiet unconcern registered
on his face had he known that any honest
person, let alone Johnny, was looking
upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s magic!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed. At the
same instant he knew this was not true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; he exclaimed once again.</p>
<p>He leaped for the door. It was locked. It
was a massive door. He could not hope to
break it down, even should he desire to do so.</p>
<p>He raced to the window and threw up the
sash. It was a quiet, sunshiny day. There were
people passing in the street. To attract their
attention would be an easy matter. But did he
wish to do this? Had he a right to do so?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will promise to betray none of our
secrets?&rdquo; the professor had said. He had
promised. The outer air cooled his heated
brow. Slowly he turned about, retraced his
steps, then sank down in his chair. He would
watch. That, after all, was what he had been
told to do. Perhaps in the end he would learn
a great deal, just watching.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>The hour that followed will stand out in
Johnny&rsquo;s mind as a vivid memory as long as
Johnny draws a breath. He was looking, he
knew beyond the shadow of a doubt, upon the
living image of the one man he most feared
and hated, Iggy the Snake. He was watching
his every gesture, every movement of his lips
and eyes; yet he could not touch him nor
speak to him. He could not say to the policeman
on the corner, &ldquo;Officer, this man is a
thief and a murderer! Arrest him!&rdquo; He did
not know even where the man was. He might,
for all he knew, be in the next room or a mile
away. He could only watch.</p>
<p>Watch he did, and that which he saw was
well worth his hour of waiting.</p>
<p>But to wait, powerless to act, to sit there
biting his lips, clenching his fists, watching
that smiling, grimacing image, that was terrible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>For a long time there was only that face.
Smiling, talking, bobbing his head, Iggy was
beyond doubt telling a very interesting story.
Once as he threw back his head his fist came
swinging into view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if he were showing how he struck me!&rdquo;
Johnny sprang from his chair. Then, reluctantly,
he settled back.</p>
<p>Well that he did, for a moment later the
man in that distorted living picture partially
disappeared and a cardboard box came into
view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Johnny muttered, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the
box I bought, the very one!&rdquo; There could be
no doubt about that. He could even distinguish
the yellow express label.</p>
<p>But this was not all, not nearly all. The
package disappeared. Iggy&rsquo;s head bent low.
Presently he held the metal lamp to view. He
was laughing, was Iggy.</p>
<p>It was strange, sitting there looking on.
That laugh was so real, so uproarious, Johnny
felt that he should hear it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if I were deaf,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>But wait! There was still more. Once again
&ldquo;the Snake&rdquo; bent his head. When his hands
came up this time they were filled with bundles
of paper. At first, with their edges toward
him, Johnny could make nothing of this.
But now Iggy&rsquo;s hand turned about, and Johnny
saw.</p>
<p>His mouth flew open in astonishment.
Those papers were bonds. There were hundreds
of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stolen bonds!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;The
bonds that broke a bank and made paupers of
thousands!&rdquo; He could not believe his eyes.
The bonds had been in that package! It had
been his, his! He had bought it. Had he looked
closely, he would have found those bonds. And
now&mdash;</p>
<p>A sinking feeling at the pit of his stomach
caused him to double over. He saw it all now,
clear as day. Those were &ldquo;hot&rdquo; bonds. Someone
had taken them away, perhaps to New
York. They had been frightened, had concealed
them in that package and shipped them
back. The person at the other end, more afraid
than his confederate, had refused to accept the
shipment. The package was to be sold at auction.
Afraid to bid it in, Iggy had induced
Johnny to buy it. When Johnny tried to take
the package to his lodging, Iggy and his men
had fallen upon him, robbed him of the package,
and hit him on the head in the bargain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Johnny hissed, &ldquo;is Chapter One.
There will be other chapters to this little romance
of the underworld.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again his eyes were upon that square of
glass. Iggy had, beyond doubt, replaced the
treasure. He was smiling and going through
the motions of drinking. A moment more and
he was gone. The glass went black. The spot
of yellow light reappeared. And then, to Johnny&rsquo;s
vast amazement, he found himself looking
once more at the uninteresting Dutch master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind.&rdquo; He sprang from his chair.
&ldquo;Felix will return. He will know where Iggy
was when he put on this little show. I&rsquo;ll get
Drew Lane and Tom Howe. We&rsquo;ll crash the
door, and then perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>He did not finish. Instead he sprang for the
door. He was prepared now, if such a thing
were possible, to break it down. He put his
hand to the knob. It turned. The door opened.
<i>It was not locked.</i></p>
<p>He was a long time finding Felix; a much
longer time finding Drew Lane and Tom
Howe, who were out on a hot scent. It was
dark when he at last led them to the street
that faces the lake where the gaunt towers of
the deserted Fair grounds hung dark against
the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />A STRANGE TREASURE</h2>
<p>In the meantime, the girl from Kansas who
had found a home on Maxwell Street had
made a rather wonderful discovery and found
herself well on the road to adventure.</p>
<p>At the moment Johnny and the two young
detectives arrived at the street of the &ldquo;House
of Magic,&rdquo; far away on Maxwell Street Grace
Krowl was staring into the friendly eyes of a
white-haired book seller and saying, &ldquo;Do&mdash;do
you think it is val&mdash;valuable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valuable!&rdquo; Frank Morrow, the genial,
white-haired proprietor of the little book shop
on Peoria, just off Maxwell Street, stared at
her over his glasses. &ldquo;Valuable! My child, if
that signature is genuine it is priceless.&rdquo; For
the second time he held a ponderous volume,
an ancient Bible with hand-tooled leather cover,
to the light and read aloud:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As a token of gratitude for a great service
done to our nation and to the crown.</p>
<p>Her Majesty, the Queen,</p>
<p><span class="jr">Elizabeth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;If that signature is genuine,&rdquo; he repeated,
&ldquo;and I have little doubt of it, this book is
worth thousands of dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thing is,&rdquo; Grace sighed, &ldquo;to find the rightful
owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rightful owner!&rdquo; Frank Morrow stared at
her. Nida McFay, his assistant, joined in the
stare. &ldquo;Rightful owner!&rdquo; Morrow repeated.
&ldquo;<i>You</i> are the rightful owner. Your uncle
bought that horsehair trunk at auction for
three dollars. You purchased it from him for
double that amount. This Bible was in the
trunk. It is yours. The law will uphold you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But is the law always right? Is there
not a law higher than man&rsquo;s law?&rdquo; Grace&rsquo;s
tone was deeply serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Frank Morrow, rather bluntly,
&ldquo;is for you to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decide,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;all I&rsquo;ve done since
I came to Chicago has been to decide, de&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>She broke off to stare at the door of the
book shop. It had been quietly opened. A tall
man stood there. He was well-dressed, far too
well for Maxwell Street. He was neither young
nor old. His features were regular. He seemed
quite a gentleman. Then the girl got a look
into his eyes. She shuddered. They were hard
as steel.</p>
<p>Next instant she was staring at Nida McFay.
Her face had gone ashy white. She was
grasping the table as if about to fall.</p>
<p>When she was able to look again at the door,
Grace found it closed. The man had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s as if I had not seen him,&rdquo; she told
herself. One look at Nida, who was very white,
told her that for the time at least it was better
that the man should remain unseen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you do,&rdquo; Frank Morrow was saying&mdash;he
had not seen the stranger&mdash;&ldquo;you
should guard this Bible with great care. Beyond
doubt, it was given by Queen Elizabeth
as a token of great esteem to some Protestant
bishop. Someone doubtless inherited this Bible
containing the Queen&rsquo;s signature and brought
it to America. Where has it been since? Who
knows? Enough that it is here and that many
a collector of rare books would, even in these
times, pay a king&rsquo;s ransom to possess it. So
guard it with care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bi&mdash;Bible. Oh, yes.&rdquo; The girl put her
hands upon it.</p>
<p>That Bible had come from the little horsehair
trunk she had saved from her uncle&rsquo;s purchase
at an express auction.</p>
<p>She had taken the trunk to her room, but in
her excitement over other matters had failed
to open it at her first opportunity.</p>
<p>After looking at it a long time next day,
without prying off the lock and peeking inside,
she had decided that she must, if possible,
have it for her very own. So she asked her
uncle to sell her the trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you have opened
that little trunk? You have found a diamond,
or maybe some stocks and bonds? Now you
want to buy it for a little.&rdquo; His small, hard
eyes gleamed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She had held her ground. &ldquo;I have
not opened it. You may go and see that it is
still locked. But I&mdash;I like the trunk and I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
sure I should have loved its owner. That&mdash;that&rsquo;s
why I want to buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; He had smiled broadly. &ldquo;But
I must have a profit. Six dollars. You may
have it for that. I will take it from your pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my child&mdash;&rdquo; He had laid a hand gently
on her arm. &ldquo;You must not do these things.
They make you soft. And soft you must not be
in this business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she had remained &ldquo;soft.&rdquo; She
had purchased the trunk &ldquo;with contents, if
any.&rdquo; She had picked the lock with a hairpin
and had spent three happy, tearful hours poring
over its contents. The person who lost the
trunk was named Emily Anne Sheldon. She
had two sisters. Their pictures were all there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sweetest little old ladies one may ever
hope to see,&rdquo; Grace had assured herself. &ldquo;What
a shame that this trunk should have been lost!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>There were bundles of letters tied with faded
ribbons. The letters were like a beautiful
song, sung at sunset. &ldquo;If only the whole world
were like these three dear old ladies,&rdquo; she had
sighed.</p>
<p>The blankets in that trunk were of finest
wool, and very old. Perhaps they had been
hand-woven. She could not tell. There was a
blue and white bedspread that was hand-woven,
she was sure of that. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s worth
several times what I paid for the trunk,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t sell it. I&rsquo;ll get in
touch with Emily Anne and send it all back
for a Christmas present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the very bottom of the trunk she had
found the ancient family Bible. For a long
time she had left it there. Then she had decided
to show it to Frank Morrow and his assistant,
Nida McFay, and here she was. And
Frank Morrow was telling her it was worth
many hundreds of dollars!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wr&mdash;wrap it up.&rdquo; She all but shuddered at
thought of the wealth she was about to bear
away under her arm. &ldquo;Wrap it up and I&rsquo;ll take
it home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Now wondering at Nida&rsquo;s sudden fear at
sight of the stranger, and now puzzling over
the problem of the apparently priceless book,
Grace left the store to walk slowly down Maxwell
Street.</p>
<p>At once her mind was filled with a hundred
thoughts. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;is my
crowded hour.&rdquo; And indeed, since that strange
day when she had walked into her uncle&rsquo;s unusual
store and had begun a fight for her few
possessions, every hour had seemed crowded.</p>
<p>There was the mysterious &ldquo;Whisperer&rdquo; and
his strange visits at dawn. How did his whisper
come to her? She had tried in every way to
trap him, but with no success. Did he indeed
talk to her &ldquo;down a beam of light&rdquo; from the
window of a skyscraper a mile away? And
could he see that far too? It seemed preposterous.
And yet&mdash;</p>
<p>Drew Lane had visited the store three times.
Always he wore the jaunty clothes of a college
boy. But once she had gripped his arm
and found it hard as steel. He was a man, no
mistaking that, and a city detective of the
highest type. Was he the Whisperer? It
seemed absurd to suspect him. &ldquo;We all whisper
alike,&rdquo; she had told herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>So, quite unconscious of her surroundings,
she walked on, thinking hard. She had covered
two blocks when of a sudden she felt a
hand on her arm and heard in a low, chilling
tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next instant she found herself looking into
the face of the man who, a half hour before,
had so frightened Nida McFay.</p>
<p>Never in all her life had she wanted so much
to scream. The precious Bible was still under
her arm. Those cold eyes were fixed upon
her.</p>
<p>Ten seconds of thought assured her that she
was in no immediate danger. The shops were
still open. She was surrounded by friends. In
her brief stay on the street she had made many
friends. Max Schmalgemeire, the baker, stood
in his door; so too did Mamma Lebed, who
sold geese. Peter Rapport was turning his hot
dogs. Even Madam Jakolev, the gypsy fortune-teller,
whom she strongly suspected of
carrying a dagger up her sleeve, was a welcome
sight at that moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I merely wanted to ask you a question.&rdquo;
The man was polite enough. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo;
his words were distinct and cold, &ldquo;this girl
Nida McFay is a police character?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Po&mdash;Police?&rdquo; Grace stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically that. Frank Morrow&rsquo;s is the
only place she could sell books in this city.
He is stubborn, foolhardy. Just thought I&rsquo;d
warn you. I am J. Templeton Semp, a detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tipped his hat and was gone, leaving
Grace with a sinking sensation at the pit of
her stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A police character!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;How
could she be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was to hear more of Nida next morning,
for the &ldquo;Whisperer&rdquo; was to be with her once
more at dawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />&ldquo;THE EYE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>As we have said, it was dark when Johnny
Thompson finally returned to the &ldquo;Street
of Mystery,&rdquo; as he had come to call it. Felix&rsquo;s
answer to his excited questioning at an earlier
hour had been strange. Yes, he knew where
the men were that Johnny had seen in that animated
picture&mdash;at least, he knew where they
had been when Johnny looked at them; they
were in the house down the street where he
and Johnny had planted wires and instruments.
Had Johnny really seen the men?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen them!&rdquo; Johnny fairly raved. &ldquo;I recognized
one of them as surely as if he had
been my brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; Felix smiled blandly. &ldquo;That
proves the thing will work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But these men!&rdquo; Johnny exploded. &ldquo;We
must get them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, must we?&rdquo; Felix showed surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we must. They are robbers, murderers.
They have bonds in their possession that
broke a bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Felix stared. &ldquo;Well&mdash;that&rsquo;s not in
our field. We are inventors, not detectives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will get Drew Lane, Tom Howe and Captain
Burns.&rdquo; Johnny was poised to rush away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you like. Here&rsquo;s the key.&rdquo; Felix extended
his hand. &ldquo;Be sure to lock the door. We
are responsible for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lock the door,&rdquo; Johnny grumbled to himself
as he hurried away &ldquo;Queerest fellow I
ever saw, that Felix. Smart, though. Shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if his inventions would do a lot of
good. Think of being able to look right in
upon a pack of thieves and you half a block
or half a mile away!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lock the door!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;May be so
riddled with bullets before we get through that
it won&rsquo;t even shut.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>In this last he was wrong. When the little
band, Johnny, Drew, Tom and the hulking
Spider, reached the place, they found it dark.
There was no answer to the bell, nor to repeated
rapping. When they unlocked the door
and, flashlights in left hands, guns in right,
made the rounds of the place, they found it deserted
and still. The rooms were rented furnished.
The furniture was there, but not a
garment, not a scrap of paper, not a single
article that told of occupation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are gone for good,&rdquo; was Drew&rsquo;s pronouncement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I saw them this very afternoon,&rdquo;
Johnny said soberly. &ldquo;Saw the bonds, too. To
think I once had them and I lost them so
easily!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all make mistakes,&rdquo; Drew consoled.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting hotter and hotter on their trail.
We&rsquo;ll get them, you&rsquo;ll see, and that very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the place in silence, locking the
door behind them.</p>
<p>They made their way to the &ldquo;House of
Magic,&rdquo; where Felix joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find anyone?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid they might be. But that thing
worked&mdash;that&rsquo;s the best of it. A little more
work on it and we&rsquo;ll be ready to turn it over to
those who can make the best use of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Johnny,&rdquo; Drew Lane put in,
&ldquo;you should have a phone in your room. You
may have something to report any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny had not told Felix of the Whisperer&rsquo;s
message. Felix had many secrets, why not
he?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put a phone in at once,&rdquo; Felix assured
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, goodnight, then.&rdquo; Drew Lane and
his companions disappeared into the dark,
leaving Johnny and Felix standing on the steps
of the &ldquo;House of Magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy to put a phone in,&rdquo; Felix said. &ldquo;House
is full of wires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of eyes,&rdquo; Johnny added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;&lsquo;House of a Thousand Eyes,&rsquo;&rdquo; Felix
chuckled. &ldquo;Want to know about &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, watch.&rdquo; Felix rang the bell. The
door opened itself. &ldquo;An eye did that,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;An electric eye. Step inside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Johnny did so. As on that other occasion,
the narrow space was filled with a strange
light; then he saw skeletons, his own and Felix&rsquo;s,
wavering before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eye does that,&rdquo; Felix explained again.
&ldquo;The electric eye and X-ray. Eye turns on the
current that starts the X-ray going. Quite a
convenience. If your would-be visitors carry
hard things like guns or knives, you see them
and need not admit them unless you want to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are seeing ourselves now,&rdquo; he chuckled,
&ldquo;as we have never been, but as we shall be.
Come inside.&rdquo; The skeletons vanished. The
next door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In five minutes the &lsquo;eye&rsquo; will have made us
a cup of cocoa.&rdquo; Felix sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really very simple,&rdquo; he went on after a
moment. &ldquo;The electric eye, or photo-electric
cell, is a vacuum tube treated chemically on
the inside. A peep hole admits light. When
light strikes the chemicals it starts a small
electric discharge. This electric discharge,
when stepped up, will start any piece of mechanism
you may wish it to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It works as well when I cut off the light
as when I turn it on. So, when I pass before
a light in the wall that plays on one electric
eye, it causes the door to open. Another closes
the door, and so forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now an &lsquo;eye&rsquo; turned on the current
under a pan of milk. When the milk is hot and
rises in the pan, a second eye slides the pan
aside and adds the cocoa and sugar. So we
have steaming cocoa with no trouble at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impractical?&rdquo; He threw back his head and
laughed. &ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s lots of fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the eye is revolutionizing the world,
for all that!&rdquo; he added, handing Johnny his cocoa.
&ldquo;I told you we fixed up a rig for sorting
a carload of beans a day. That is done by
thousands of electric eyes. Pineapples are sorted
the same way. In school rooms an eye
watches the light. When it gets too dark the
eye throws on the lighting switch. The eye
umpires bowling matches and would umpire
a baseball game, call a ball a ball, a strike a
strike, and never be wrong. And that certainly
would be something!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s enough for tonight. I&rsquo;ll get
that phone.&rdquo; He hurried away.</p>
<p>It was not enough, not half enough for Johnny.
He wanted to ask if the eye had helped
him see what he had seen that afternoon, if
the eye could have anything to do with the
whispers at dawn. He wanted to ask a hundred
questions. But Felix was gone.</p>
<p>When Johnny mounted to his room, he
found the telephone in its place on a stand by
his bed, but Felix was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />THE TRAP IS SPRUNG</h2>
<p>As a rule, Johnny was a heavy sleeper. All
the strange doings of the past few days
must have gotten on his nerves, for next morning,
more than an hour before dawn, he found
himself lying in bed wide awake, thinking.</p>
<p>The ceiling of his room, he noticed, had
dropped again during the night. This neither
surprised nor disturbed him. In fact, in this
strange house had the attraction of gravity
been reversed and had he found his bed resting
on the ceiling instead of the floor, he would
not have been greatly surprised.</p>
<p>He was, however, curious about many
things. This room that had a way of growing
small, with its strange light where there were
no lamps, intrigued him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>The matter of the locked door of the previous
day had been solved. Felix had been experimenting
with a new type of time lock and
had forgotten to throw the electrical switch
that controlled it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that living picture on the wall!&rdquo; Johnny
thought to himself. &ldquo;How is one to explain
that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the whisper? Where does that come
from? It can&rsquo;t be a broadcast, and he can&rsquo;t be
close at hand.&rdquo; Drew had told him the evening
before that Grace Krowl had said she had
heard the Whisperer in her room more than a
mile away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The message was not the same,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;Not nearly the same. She did not
get my message. I did not get hers. He is a
very particular person, this Whisperer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts went back to that day he
bought the express package that had come so
near causing his death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I had those bonds!&rdquo; he groaned aloud.
How was this affair to end? Would Drew Lane
and his band come up with these outlaws?
Would there be a battle? Would he, Johnny
Thompson, be in at the finish? He devoutly
hoped so. He thought again of Madame LeClare
and her fine children who had lost a
father. He saw the dark, smiling eyes of Alice.
&ldquo;As long as God gives us breath!&rdquo; he repeated.
It was a pledge and a prayer.</p>
<p>His thoughts had returned to the mysterious
Whisperer when he was given a sudden start
by the loud jangle of a bell.</p>
<p>He sprang out of bed. The bell appeared to
be in the room. &ldquo;Like an alarm clock,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;But there is no clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the reflector on the wall. The
moonlight was falling upon it&mdash;or was that
some other form of light? He could not tell.
The sound seemed to come from there.</p>
<p>He began pacing the room. The bell still
jangled. But of a sudden he halted in amazement.
As he crossed before the reflector the
sound had ceased for the space of a second,
then began again. He tried it again and got
the same result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange!&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>Just then the jangling ceased and in its stead
came the familiar voice of the Whisperer:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny! Johnny Thompson! Are you
there? Are you awake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Whisperer?&rdquo; Johnny breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; the message went on, &ldquo;I have an
important message for your friends. Phone
them at once. The men they want are at 1046
Blair Street. They are in a small, yellow sedan.
They are in a garage, having their car repaired.
Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did hurry. He called the shack and
had Drew on the wire at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Drew said, &ldquo;Tom is here with me,
and so are the Captain and Spider. Thanks for
the tip, Johnny. We are on our way at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; Johnny sighed. He
knew, though he regretted it tremendously,
that he could not hope to join them in this
adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here and wait for any further message,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;Wonder if Drew and
the rest will really come up to Iggy and his
gang? If they do, man! oh, man!&rdquo; He could
just hear the guns popping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>There was, however, no such luck, at least
for the moment. As the happy, fighting four,
Drew and his band, neared the garage at 1046
Blair Street, they saw a low, yellow sedan pop
out of the garage door and go speeding north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sure to be them. After them! Give
her the gas!&rdquo; the Captain shouted.</p>
<p>Drew sent the Captain&rsquo;s powerful car speeding
after.</p>
<p>The yellow car shot straight north for a
mile. Then it whirled round a corner on two
wheels.</p>
<p>When Drew and his band rounded that corner
there was no car in sight&mdash;only a huge,
lumbering moving-van two blocks to the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Street ends two blocks west,&rdquo; the Captain
snapped. &ldquo;Must have gone east. Drive slow
and watch the north and south streets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>This they did. They were still going slow
as they passed the van. Spider, who had been
sitting in the back seat with Tom Howe, was
startled a moment later to find that Tom was
no longer with him. He was not in the car.
He was gone.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime, Johnny Thompson was in
the midst of a strange discovery. Ten minutes
after the first message had been delivered, the
bell began its jangle once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed. &ldquo;Big Ben
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Springing to his feet, he began walking back
and forth before the round reflector. As on the
other occasion, the bell ceased jangling as he
passed.</p>
<p>A series of rapid experiments with a hat held
in his hand showed him he could shut off the
bell by holding the hat in certain positions.
These positions, he found, must be higher and
higher as he receded from the reflector toward
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing I know,&rdquo; he assured himself.
&ldquo;That sound is produced by some force outside
my window. And the person who produces
it must be very high up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In fact&mdash;&rdquo; He caught his breath as he
looked out of the window and away to the
east. &ldquo;There is but one place it could come
from. That is the top of the six hundred foot
tower of the Sky Ride on those deserted Century
of Progress grounds. The Whisperer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off short to listen with all his ears.
The ringing of that bell ceased, the whispered
message was beginning.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>What had happened to the slender young
detective, Tom Howe? Something rather
strange, I assure you.</p>
<p>Having slipped from the slowly moving police
car, he had mounted the running board
of the vast lumbering van. From this point
he slid to a position beside the driver. As he
did this he prodded the driver in the ribs with
an automatic and whispered, &ldquo;You will drive
as I say and where I say, or you are a dead
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver never took his eye from the road.
He drove straight on.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The message Johnny Thompson received
after the second ringing of the bell was but a
repetition of the first, so his mind was soon
put to rest. He was left with plenty to wonder
about, for all that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>But dawn was now breaking. Like departing
fairies, the Whisperer had other business
that must be attended to. He was heard next
in Grace Krowl&rsquo;s little parlor on Maxwell
Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas Eve will be here in three more
days,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;On Christmas Eve everyone
is in a mellow mood. That is the time
for confiding secrets. On that evening, my
friend Grace, you are to invite Nida McFay
to your room, seat her beside your table and
induce her to tell her story. I shall be looking
in upon you from my high tower a mile away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;High tower, a mile away!&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;How can one see that far? And the shade is
always half drawn. It is impossible!&rdquo; And yet,
the Whisperer had more than once convinced
her that he did see her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Christmas Eve!&rdquo; she exclaimed indignantly.
&ldquo;How can one ask another to bare her
life&rsquo;s secrets at such a time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>It was a sober-faced Grace Krowl who seated
herself before the table for a few moments
of quiet thought. In the days just past she
had tried out her plan of writing to people
whose stories she had found in lost trunks.
She had offered to return all their little treasures
without cost. The results had been disappointing
and disheartening. Their attitude
she had found difficult to understand. In their
letters they seemed to say, &ldquo;You have all the
things in my trunk. You have a right to none
of them.&rdquo; She had returned the pictures and
letters from six trunks. She had paid the express
charges out of her own meager funds.
Not one of them all had made an effort to repay
these charges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one returned to thank me.&rdquo; She stared
at the wall. &ldquo;Can it be that uncle is right?
That I am merely letting myself get &lsquo;soft&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of the priceless Bible tucked
away at the bottom of the little horsehair
trunk. Is it strange that a half-formed hope
should enter her mind, the hope that no one
would appear to claim that treasure, and that
she might have it for her very own?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A fortune! Thousands of dollars!&rdquo; she
whispered. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>When Tom Howe mounted to the seat of
that lumbering van he took one look through
a narrow slit of a window behind the driver.
The inside of the van at that time was completely
dark.</p>
<p>After riding with the driver for fully two
miles and directing his course all this time,
Tom cast another sidewise look through that
window. His lips parted in an unuttered exclamation.
The back of the van was now open,
the gate was down, and back two blocks, just
turning the corner, was a low, yellow sedan.</p>
<p>His face was a mask as he turned his attention
once more to the street that lay ahead.
Two blocks before them a red crossing light
gleamed. As the van paused for this light, he
sprang from the seat and was away like a shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! What became of you?&rdquo; the Captain
roared as a half hour later he entered the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lost their trail?&rdquo; Tom grinned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say we did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; Tom said quietly. &ldquo;In the end I
did. But I stayed with them longer than you
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stayed?&rdquo; Drew exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I did. You remember that van on the
street? They were in there, car and all!
Pulled a swift one on us. Driver lowered the
back gate and they drove up and in. Then he
lifted the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had &rsquo;em trapped like rats, I thought. I&rsquo;d
have made the driver take that van right into
our squad-car garage. And then, would there
have been fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what happened?&rdquo; Drew was staring
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near as I can find out, the driver released
the gate with some foot control. Iggy and his
gang took the hint and backed right out while
we were going. I saw them shoot round a corner.
The trap was sprung, no rat in it&mdash;so I
came home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about a cup of coffee?&rdquo; He moved
toward the stove in the corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well that,&rdquo; Drew said slowly, &ldquo;is something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be another day,&rdquo; the Captain
grumbled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />A WHISPER FROM AFAR</h2>
<p>Late that afternoon Captain Burns&rsquo; car
came to a stop before the &ldquo;House of
Magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hop in,&rdquo; he said to Johnny when the boy
appeared. &ldquo;Want to take you somewhere.
Been working on clues all day. Tired. Need
rest. Need good company. Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny, who had spent a quiet day with Felix,
being led further into the magic of the
electric eye, but being told nothing at all about
the mysteries that most intrigued him, was
ready enough to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer boy, that Felix,&rdquo; he said to the Captain
as the car sped on through the city.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t really tell me a thing I wanted to
know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he corrected himself, &ldquo;he did say
that the light about the place was made by
neon tubes set in the walls and that the light
entered the room through a million pin-pricks
in the canvas covering of the walls; also that
this light came in slowly because it was filtered
through bulbs very like radio tubes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting, but not so terribly important,&rdquo;
the Captain rumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same with that business of my room getting
tall and short,&rdquo; Johnny went on. &ldquo;Seems
his father thinks there&rsquo;s a lot of waste space in
modern homes. Bed chambers stand empty all
day, living-rooms all night, and there is never
enough air space in either. So he&rsquo;s experimenting
on floors built like elevators. You
flatten out the bedroom furniture and raise the
floor; that gives you a tall living-room during
the day. By lowering the same floor at night
you get a tall bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; the Captain laughed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
not likely to bump your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems,&rdquo; Johnny concluded, &ldquo;I had a room
intended in the beginning for a sort of parlor.
They needed the space above, so they let down
the floor. Not a bad arrangement, only they
ought to have let a fellow know. These inventors&rsquo;
heads are so full of things, they forget.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>They were now well out of the city, speeding
along a country road.</p>
<p>Thirty miles from the heart of the city they
swung through a gateway and came to a stop
before a small, low-roofed cottage.</p>
<p>It was now dark. The place seemed cold and
deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not find any ceilings falling on you
here,&rdquo; Captain Burns chuckled. &ldquo;This was my
boyhood home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your boyhood home!&rdquo; Johnny surveyed
the narrow yard surrounded by ancient maples.
He looked at the insignificant dwelling
towered over by a giant cottonwood tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you rose from this,&rdquo; he said in an awed
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Johnny,&rdquo; the Captain replied quickly.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t rise. No one ever rises above his boyhood
home. It is the grandest place on earth.
Come on in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>The place they entered was the kitchen. It
had a low ceiling. In a corner stood a small
wood-burning kitchen range with a top that
was warped and cracked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very stove,&rdquo; the Captain said
proudly, touching a match to shavings and
watching yellow flames spread. &ldquo;I cut wood
for it more than thirty years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was away from this place a long, long
time, Johnny. When I got some money I
bought it for a sort of retreat. When I am poor
again it shall be the last of my treasured possessions
to go&mdash;my boyhood home!&rdquo; he ended
reverently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I think&mdash;&rdquo; There was a rumble in
the Captain&rsquo;s throat as he began to speak after
some moments of silence. &ldquo;When I think of
the good, simple, happy times we had here, I
wonder&mdash;&rdquo; He did not finish, but sat smiling
and looking at the glowing hearth of the little,
old, cracked kitchen stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was raised in this one small room,&rdquo; he
began once more. &ldquo;Oh, yes, we slept upstairs.
No fire up there, not a spark. Cold!&rdquo; He
chuckled. &ldquo;Twenty below sometimes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But this room, it was home to us. Home.&rdquo;
He said it softly. &ldquo;I can see it now. The table
there and the yellow glow of a kerosene lamp.
Father dozing by the fire. Brother Tom reading.
He was a scholar, Tom was. Made a fine
man, he would, if&mdash;&rdquo; Once more he did not
finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father was a pious man,&rdquo; he rumbled on
after a time. &ldquo;Wonder how many sons of truly
pious men make their mark in the world?
Many of them, I believe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always had prayers on our knees before
we went upstairs. Father&rsquo;s prayer was
always much the same. One sentence I remember
well: &lsquo;We thank Thee, our Father, that it
is well with us as it is.&rsquo; It wasn&rsquo;t very well
with us all the time. But we had peace. The
doors were never locked. Precious little to
steal, and no one to steal it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Sometimes I wonder
whether this eternal struggle is worth the cost.
When I got older and went out with my father
to help with the work, when we came rattling
home in the dark in our old lumber wagon, we
had peace. No one wanted to kill us. But
now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Once again he did not finish. There was no
need. Full well Johnny knew that there were
those who wished this faithful officer beneath
the sod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when the city gets you&mdash;&rdquo; The Captain&rsquo;s
tone had changed. &ldquo;When it gets you,
there&rsquo;s no turning back. The noise, the rush,
the excitement of life that flows on and on
like a torrent&mdash;it <i>gets</i> you, and you never, never
turn back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember the story of poor old Lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember.&rdquo; Johnny knew that
great old book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always felt sorry for Lot.&rdquo; The Captain
chuckled. &ldquo;Country chap come to the city
to live. Got his wife turned to salt, he did.
Lost about all he had. But he couldn&rsquo;t help it.
City got him. Sodom got him. Chicago&rsquo;s got
you and me, Johnny. And Chicago won&rsquo;t let
us go until they bring us out to some spot like
the one we passed a mile from here, and put
us away where the hemlocks sing and sigh
over the marble that is white in the moonlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll fight on, Johnny.&rdquo; He prodded the
fire. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t accomplish much. No one
ever does. But we&rsquo;ll do our bit&mdash;do it like
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Johnny&mdash;&rdquo; He rose and stretched himself.
&ldquo;It helps to come out here now and then
where I have known so much peace. Just to sit
by this old, cracked stove, to listen to the whisper
of the wind, the song of the tree toads and
the whoo-whooting of some owl, and dream I
am a boy again, just a boy. Ah, son, that&rsquo;s
good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back to the city in a little while,&rdquo;
he went on after a time. &ldquo;Get a good bed somewhere
in town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that reminds me, Johnny. I want you
out here on Christmas Eve. We&rsquo;ll make up a
party and stay all night. Hang up our stockings
just as we boys used to do. We&rsquo;ll bring
out Drew and Tom, Joyce Mills, Mrs. LeClare
and Alice; yes, and Spider&mdash;only we&rsquo;ll have a
whole turkey for Spider,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
have a grand time Christmas Eve and
all day Christmas. And such a dinner! I&rsquo;ve
bought a turkey, twenty-five pounds, Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come in here.&rdquo; He took up a kerosene
lamp and led the way into a second small room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was our parlor. Only lit the fire on
Sundays. Such Sundays as those were! Happy
days, Johnny! Happy days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Johnny asked suddenly.
&ldquo;Surely this does not belong to those days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; There was a queer look on the Captain&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Fellow I know, man I would trust
with my life, asked permission to put that in
here.&rdquo; They were looking at a two-foot wide
reflector such as was to be found in Johnny&rsquo;s
room in the &ldquo;House of Magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said,&rdquo; the Captain went on, &ldquo;that if the
time came when I was badly needed in the
city, a message would come to me through that
thing. How? I can&rsquo;t say. Up until now it
hasn&rsquo;t uttered a squawk. It&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Johnny held up a hand. There
was no need. The Captain was listening with
all his ears, for, into that room there on the
lonely prairie, had stolen a whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Burns!&rdquo; The words were very distinct.
&ldquo;I wish to inform you that a packet of
stolen bonds you are seeking have been sold to
Joseph Gregg of 3200 South Kemp Street.
Gregg is an honest man. But back of him&mdash;&rdquo;
The whisper faded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain, &ldquo;is all I need
to know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Racing for his coat and hat, he led the way
to his car. A moment more and they were
speeding back to the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;do you believe
that whisper came all the way from the city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A broadcast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a broadcast. I feel sure no one in
the world, save us, heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful, if true&mdash;a revolutionary idea!&rdquo;
the Captain exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;that I could name
the very spot from which that message came&mdash;the
top of the Sky Ride tower.&rdquo; He told the
Captain of his discovery regarding the whisper
he had heard that morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to look into that,&rdquo; was the Captain&rsquo;s
only comment.</p>
<p>That very night Johnny attempted to &ldquo;look
into that,&rdquo; with such results as you shall see.</p>

<br />THE SKY SLIDER</h2>
<p>Having secured Spider as his special
bodyguard and obtained permission to
enter the deserted grounds of the Century of
Progress, Johnny set out on his mission of discovery.
He was determined to learn what he
could about the mysterious Whisperer.</p>
<p>It was a dark night. Clouds hid the moon.
One of those cold, gusty nights it was, when
fine siftings of snow creep and tremble about
your feet, when sharp gusts of wind shooting
out from unexpected angles blow fine particles
of ice upon your cheek, and you say with
a start, &ldquo;Some devil of the north has been let
loose to blow his breath upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; Spider shuddered. &ldquo;How cold it is!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and ghostly!&rdquo; Johnny added. They
were on the old Fair grounds. &ldquo;When you
think what this place has been, so full of light
and sunshine, so hilarious with the screams
and shouts of jolly revelers, every corner seems
to hide a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Spider quickened his pace. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
the place where they had all those freaks&mdash;tall,
skinny men, short, crooked ones, two headed,
one legged&mdash;all sorts of funny and distorted
humans. Gee! Johnny, what a joy to have two
legs and two arms, eyes, ears and all that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and what poor use some of us make
of them!&rdquo; Johnny grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look.&rdquo; Spider was full of recollections.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s where they kept that huge snake.
Suppose he&rsquo;s in there now, all coiled up, torpid
for his winter&rsquo;s sleep?&rdquo; The thought caused
him to veer sharply to the left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts, all right,&rdquo; Johnny said quietly.
&ldquo;Ghosts of those who stood in these places
hour by hour, patiently doing their duty, roasting
hot dogs, guarding jewels, changing
money, selling tickets. Ghosts too of performers
on this hilarious Midway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ghosts of those who came to see,&rdquo;
Spider chuckled genially.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice rose. He gripped
Spider&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Do I see a light up there, or
don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tower of the Sky Ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A gaunt skeleton of steel, the towers of the
Sky Ride where, in the days of wild joy at the
Century of Progress three million thrill seekers
had shot upward to go gliding and bumping
across the sky! And, yes, there at the very
top of the left-hand tower a pale yellow light
shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Whisperer!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice was husky
with emotion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that place&mdash;&rdquo; There was doubt in Spider&rsquo;s
tone. &ldquo;That place has been locked for
months. Electric current is probably turned
off. How&rsquo;d he get up there? Six hundred feet
and more!&rdquo; There was awe in his tone. He
was a climber, was Spider&mdash;none better, so he
had supposed. Had he come upon the tracks
of one more skillful than he?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I could do it,&rdquo; he muttered beneath his
breath. &ldquo;I could climb that tower. Six hundred
feet. Bah! What&rsquo;s the diff? Two hundred,
three hundred, or six, it&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that man?&rdquo; He turned to Johnny.
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t just pucker up his lips and whisper
a mile, can he? Takes machines, instruments,
whatever you may call it, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure it does,&rdquo; Johnny agreed. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know a lot about it myself. It&rsquo;s all like
magic to me. But it must take a lot of mechanisms
and a strong electric current.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully, as they
walked slowly forward, &ldquo;the Sky Ride&rsquo;s in
somebody&rsquo;s care. Bound to be. The managers
of next year&rsquo;s Fair are going to operate it.
And if someone had some sort of a pull he
could get permission to turn on the current
and set an elevator running. He could get up
and down that way. And what a place he&rsquo;d
have for whispering! Whisper all over the
world, I&rsquo;d say. I&rsquo;d like to have a picture of
that man&mdash;if it <i>is</i> a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is?&rdquo; Spider laughed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think
he&rsquo;s an ape, or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be a woman,&rdquo; said Johnny seriously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, a woman! Fine chance!&rdquo; Spider
scoffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that dare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dare?&rdquo; Johnny stopped short in his
tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you his picture, and if it&rsquo;s a lady,
I&rsquo;ll take two pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;ll climb that tower? Six
hundred feet! You&mdash;you&rsquo;ve not been drinking,
Spider?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drinking, Johnny?&rdquo; There was a deep note
of reproach in Spider&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Whatever else
I am, Johnny, I&rsquo;m not a fool. Only a fool
drinks. And a fellow who climbs is a double
fool if he drinks. Drink, Johnny, makes you
feel as if you could fly. And that&rsquo;s a fatal feeling
when you&rsquo;re up in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Johnny, I&rsquo;m sober. You want to know
what that man looks like, what he&rsquo;s doing up
there. So do I. The elevator may be working.
Who knows? If not&mdash;up I go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Johnny agreed reluctantly. Full
well he knew how futile it is to argue with a
person of Spider&rsquo;s nature. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know when
you&rsquo;ve had enough, won&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;ll give it
up if it&rsquo;s sort of getting the best of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Spider&rsquo;s reply was a guttural mutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, you promise!&rdquo; Johnny insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have it your way,&rdquo; Spider mumbled. &ldquo;But
just you watch this flashlight. I&rsquo;ll fasten it to
my belt, behind. It will be shining straight
down. Guess you&rsquo;ll be able to see it all the
way up. It&rsquo;s pretty bright. When you see it
up there at the top you&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;when you see a white flash you&rsquo;ll
know I&rsquo;ve got the picture. Always carry a
flash-bulb and a little camera, I do. Get some
great pictures in all sorts of places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny grumbled, &ldquo;and some time
you&rsquo;ll get your head blown off in the bargain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah?&rdquo; Spider laughed a crackly sort of
laugh.</p>
<p>The elevator to the Sky Ride tower might or
might not have been working. The two boys
had no way to tell. The door to the place was
locked and bolted, apparently from within.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well pleased,&rdquo; Spider chuckled.
&ldquo;Always have wanted to climb that thing since
I saw the first two sections sticking up out of
the snow in 1933&mdash;so here goes!&rdquo; He was
away up the steel frame, like a monkey.</p>
<p>It was with a feeling akin to awe that
Johnny saw that small, wavering spot of yellow
light mount up, up, up toward the spot
where some bright star lay hidden behind a
cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never climb so high,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t have let him try. And yet&mdash;&rdquo; There
was a mystery to be solved, and mysteries at
times are to be solved only by deeds of daring.
So he watched the light at Spider&rsquo;s back mount
and mount until it was but a tiny speck of
yellow light that, winking and blinking, rose
ever higher and higher.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>As for Spider, he was not disturbed. A
climber from the age of six, he had within him
supreme self-confidence. What is distance anyway?
If you fall at fifty feet you will die. Can
six hundred be worse? Thus he reasoned and,
mounting higher and higher, thought only of
his goal. He would have a look into that room
of mystery. He&rsquo;d surprise someone at his work
and, be he man, woman or devil&mdash;flash! There
would be a picture.</p>
<p>He was right in part&mdash;at least, the flash was
not lacking; for, having at last scaled the
height, he stood upon a steel cross-beam to
draw his chin above a steel window frame.
And there he hung, drinking in with his eyes
the scene that lay before him.</p>
<p>The right-hand corner of a broad, glass-enclosed
space had been roughly partitioned off
into a small room. At the center of this narrow
space, bending over some curious instrument,
was a tall, thin man.</p>
<p>That he was not conscious of prying eyes
was at once apparent, for, after a moment, partially
straightening up, he switched on a powerful
lamp, thus sending a sharp pencil of illumination
through the clouds that hung over
the city.</p>
<p>This accomplished, he turned half about.</p>
<p>Spider dropped low, he might be seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>When next he dared bring his eyes above
the edge of the window frame he found the
man facing a peculiar square of metal attached
to a low pedestal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A microphone! He&rsquo;s talking into it. The
Whisperer!&rdquo; Spider breathed.</p>
<p>Then with the force of a blow it came to
him that here was his chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The picture,&rdquo; he muttered low.</p>
<p>Twisting an arm about a steel beam, with
no thought of the dizzy depths below, with
fingers that trembled ever so slightly, he adjusted
an electric light bulb, half filled with a
sort of tinfoil, to his flashlight. Then adjusting
his small camera, he shifted his position,
held camera and flashlight high, then pressed
a button.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>The result was most astonishing. A bright
flash was to be expected. The tinfoil filled bulb
was such as newspaper photographers use for
taking flashlight pictures. Yes, that first bright
flash was to be expected. The second, following
closely upon the first and accompanied by
a sharp report, had not been anticipated. A
bullet burned Spider&rsquo;s ear. With a cry of consternation,
he released his grip, dropped a
short way toward the black depths below,
struck a steel beam, threw out his hands,
clutched something cold and substantial, then
hung there between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>The first indication that all had not gone
well came to Johnny when some object falling
from the sky crashed upon a square of wind-blown
pavement not twenty feet from where
he stood.</p>
<p>Springing forward, he cast the light of his
electric torch upon some black fragments scattered
over the spot where the thing had struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the camera!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Spider&rsquo;s
camera. There&rsquo;ll be no picture. But Spider.
What of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind that whistled about the foot of
the Sky Ride tower brought him no answer.</p>
<p>He had been watching the top of that tower
for a full five minutes when some object, gliding
along a cluster of four cables closely set
together and running at a broad angle from
the top of the tower to the ground, suddenly
caught his attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can that be a man?&rdquo; he asked himself, staring
with all his eyes as the thing moved downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a man, is it Spider or the Whisperer?&rdquo;
he asked himself a moment later.</p>
<p>Determined to know, he went racing away
toward the end of the cable, some three blocks
away.</p>
<p>He arrived just in time to see the slider drop
to earth. It was Spider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a sky-slider, I am!&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny. &ldquo;Did you
see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very clearly. He&rsquo;s a man, all right.
And he&rsquo;s a tiger. Nearly got me. Never
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spider led the way off the grounds.</p>
<p>And so for the time the mystery of the Whisperer
remained unsolved. Only this was known
with a fair degree of certainty: his place of
retreat was one high tower of the Sky Ride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />CHRISTMAS EVE</h2>
<p>The dawn of the day before Christmas arrived
and with it, in Grace Krowl&rsquo;s tiny
parlor, came the hoarse whisper of the mysterious
one:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight,&rdquo; it insisted, &ldquo;you will not fail me.
It is for the good of all. You owe us more than
you know. It is we who beautified your living
quarters. Your coming disturbed our plans.
But if you do this thing for us you shall be
forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plans.&rdquo; It was her turn to whisper. &ldquo;What
plans?&rdquo; She wanted to know.</p>
<p>A half hour later, when she descended to the
street she found Drew Lane standing by the
store door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw a small leather bag through the window,&rdquo;
he explained. &ldquo;Think I&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With some irrelevance Grace said quickly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Drew Lane, how could anyone see you a
mile away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Powerful telescope, perhaps.&rdquo; He gave her
a strange look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in your room, with the shade half
drawn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not possible. Television, possibly that.&rdquo;
His voice dropped to a near whisper. &ldquo;They
do strange things with that, I&rsquo;m told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; He looked her squarely in the
eye. &ldquo;That Whisperer again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does he claim to see you as well as
talk to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does see me. I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange!&rdquo; Drew Lane did not appear
to be shamming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be,&rdquo; she asked herself, &ldquo;that this
young man is not the Whisperer, and that he
knows nothing about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Drew, he stood there considering the
advisability of inviting this girl to the Captain&rsquo;s
Christmas party. He left without having
arrived at a definite decision. Some hours
later he was to be devoutly thankful that he
had not given the invitation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Christmas Eve came. By nine o&rsquo;clock the
tracks of two large automobiles might have
been seen winding through the freshly fallen
snow before the Captain&rsquo;s boyhood home, and
from there away to the shed serving as a garage
at the right of the house.</p>
<p>From the windows there stole a mellow
light. Caught and flung high, curls of blue
wood smoke rose from the chimneys.</p>
<p>The guests were seated in the tiny parlor of
their beloved Captain&rsquo;s old home. There were
two young detectives, Drew Lane and Tom
Howe, with their youthful understudies, Johnny
Thompson and Spider. Madame LeClare
was there too with Alice, her daughter, and
Joyce Mills. Quite a jolly party they were on
this Christmas Eve. Only one thought marred
their pleasure&mdash;the Captain was not with
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough,&rdquo; he had said to them at the last
moment. &ldquo;Something big just broke. I&rsquo;ve got
to get on the trail while it&rsquo;s hot. But you folks
go right along out. Hang your stockings up
behind the old stove like good little children,
and maybe you&rsquo;ll catch me filling them when
you get up in the morning. And if you don&rsquo;t&mdash;may
that Christmas turkey be tender!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those had been his words. Now, as Johnny
sat dreaming beside the cracked stove that,
despite its age, sent forth a cheering glow, he
imagined the Captain skulking down some
dark alley in quest of those who would disturb
the tranquillity of Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost wish I were with him,&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sharp wind blowing. The snow
was drifting. Outside, close to the road, a
windmill stood on its tall, steel tower. From
time to time the wind, giving this mill a twist,
caused it to send forth a sharp, grating scream
that seemed a human cry of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; Johnny whispered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something
spooky about a lonely country place at
night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>A moment more and his thoughts were back
with the Captain. &ldquo;The wind,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;will be whistling about the corners of skyscrapers
tonight. The snow will go scooting
and whirling away and away just as it does
among the crags of the Rockies. Cities are
like that. Wonder where the Captain is now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then again he seemed to hear the Captain&rsquo;s
rumbling voice as in this very room he told of
his boyhood days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the very stove&mdash;&rdquo; He spoke aloud
now. Pretty Alice LeClare turned her shining
black eyes upon him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the very stove that
burned here many years ago when the Captain
was a boy. He found it in the barn loft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these chairs,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;are the
very chairs on which he hung his stockings so
long ago. He found them in the attic, bottoms
gone, some broken. He had them restored.
Seems&mdash;&rdquo; His voice went husky.
&ldquo;Seems almost a sacred place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> sacred,&rdquo; Alice whispered back. &ldquo;The
boyhood home of a good man, the things he
loved, are <i>always</i> sacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny could have loved the little French
Canadian for that speech.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what a privilege,&rdquo; Alice murmured
low, &ldquo;just for one night to live as he lived, so
simple, so plain, so true. To hang up our stockings,
feeling that they will be filled, not by
lavish hands, but by loving ones, with the
simple things that only real love can find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But listen!&rdquo; Johnny touched her arm.
&ldquo;How that windmill screams! It seems a&mdash;a
sort of warning. Perhaps our night will not be
so serene after all. Per&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off. From the wall where
the broad reflector stood facing the open window
there had come a sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a whisper,&rdquo; Johnny thought. Whisper
or not, it made no sense. So again the
room fell into silence. Only the crackle of the
fire, the racing tick-tock, tick-tock of the little
clock on the mantel told that this little gray
house was still the habitation of man.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>That night, over a cup of tea in Grace
Krowl&rsquo;s parlor, with the Whisperer looking on
&ldquo;from his tower a mile away&rdquo; Nida McFay
told her story. It was a strange story filled
with smiles and tears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>For three glorious years she had worked in
the book department of one of America&rsquo;s most
beautiful stores. Surrounded by books, with
congenial fellow workers and cultured customers,
she had learned what it meant to truly
live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo; The little book seller looked
away. &ldquo;Then a man, a very little, wistful old
man who lived in my rooming house, brought
me some books from his library; anyway, he
said they were from his library. He asked me
to sell them for him at a second-hand store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were valuable books. I&mdash;I sold them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused to sit for a time staring into her
tea cup. It was as if she sensed the fact that
someone was looking in upon them from afar,
and that she dreaded to go on.</p>
<p>From the reflector in the corner came a
strange sound. &ldquo;Like someone stifling a
cough,&rdquo; Grace thought with a shudder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The books&mdash;they had been stolen from our
store,&rdquo; Nida went on after a time. &ldquo;A detective
was put on my trail. The little old man
disappeared. A&mdash;a house detective, with eyes
like steel blades, accused me of stealing the
books!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know him,&rdquo; Grace broke in. &ldquo;He
looked into Frank Morrow&rsquo;s shop one night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, that was the man! He calls himself
J. Templeton Semp.&rdquo; Nida&rsquo;s eyes were
wild for an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made me sign a paper,&rdquo; she went on.
&ldquo;I learned later it was a confession. They discharged
me. I went to other places and asked
for work, many places. Everywhere the answer
was the same:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You worked at K&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s. We cannot employ
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice broke. &ldquo;I had been
put on the black list. I&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that to
anyone!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she sighed at last, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all. Good
old Frank Morrow took me in spite of the list.
And here I am.&rdquo; She forced a smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Five minutes later Nida was gone. Grace
sat staring at the curious reflector on the wall.
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;is Nida&rsquo;s story. And
all the time she was talking someone was looking,
listening. I am sure of that. I wonder
how? Television? I wonder what that really
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding herself enshrouded in a cloud of
gloom, she drew on her coat and, taking up a
basket filled with small boxes, she went out on
Maxwell Street.</p>
<p>Moving along from door to door, she made
brief Christmas Eve calls on the simple, kindly
people she had learned to love. The small
boxes contained homemade candy. She left
one at every door.</p>
<p>She found Mamma Lebed busy decorating
a tiny tree for her two dark-haired little ones.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much we can give them,&rdquo; she beamed.
&ldquo;But the dear ones, how they will dance and
prattle when morning comes!&rdquo; She brushed a
tear from her broad cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas!&rdquo; Grace whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same to you!&rdquo; Mamma Lebed gripped her
hand hard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Grossmuter Schmalgemeire was filling stockings.
There was no fireplace in her tiny home
back of the shop, but a straight-backed chair
did as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said a mouse would come in through the
hole in the toe, Hans did,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;But
I told him an orange would fill it up. And so
it shall. I found one in the street that is not
too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Grace found them, these friends, on
every hand. Poor, but making much of the
little they had, and all filled to overflowing
with the spirit of Christmas.</p>
<p>When she returned to her rooms, her cheeks
were glowing. &ldquo;Tonight,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I
am like the moon, filled with light. The light
of happiness. It is reflected happiness, but
happiness all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, into her mind there flashed questions
that had grown old, but were ever new:
&ldquo;Who is the Whisperer? Where is he?
Why does he want Nida&rsquo;s story?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />THE WARNING</h2>
<p>In the meantime tremendous things were doing
in the little house where Captain Burns
had spent his childhood.</p>
<p>For a time, it is true, the silence in that
little gray home out where the snow lay white
and glistening on field and road continued.</p>
<p>Madame LeClare sat by the narrow drop-leaf
table knitting. Joyce Mills, with a big
black cat on her lap, seemed more than half
asleep. Dark-haired Alice had curled herself
up on two cushions beside the fire. The others
sat in dreamy silence. It did not seem a time
for small talk, this Christmas Eve. Were their
thoughts busy with other Christmas Eves?
Who can say? Were they thinking of the future,
of the approaching New Year and what
it would bring to them? Did they think at
times of the five public enemies still at large
and free to follow their evil ways? Perhaps,
at times, all these. At any rate, they were
silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Into that silence there crept a whisper. The
effect was electric! Madame dropped her knitting.
Joyce started so violently that the cat
bounced from her lap. With an involuntary
motion Drew Lane reached for his gun.
&ldquo;Lanan&mdash;&rdquo; the whisper began, &ldquo;Lanan Road,
attention! Those in Captain Burns&rsquo; old home,
attention!&rdquo; The whisper was like a call &ldquo;To
Arms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in grave danger. Grave danger!
The report is just that. I can tell you no more.
Be on your guard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whisper ceased. The clock ticked on.
From without came the hoarse scream of the
rusty windmill. The black cat, walking across
the floor, settled himself beside Alice among
the cushions.</p>
<p>As if directed by a common impulse, Drew
and Tom removed their automatics, examined
them with care, then dropped them with a little
chug back into their places.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peace on earth, good will toward men!&rdquo;
Drew quoted dryly. &ldquo;In such a world as ours
there can be no peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grave danger,&rdquo; Johnny thought to himself.
He was looking through the window to the
white silence outside. &ldquo;Danger? It does not
seems possible! Captain Burns has kept this
place a secret. We came here in a very round-about
way. Surely no one followed us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; A thought struck him squarely
between the eyes. &ldquo;And yet, the Whisperer,
alone in his tower among the stars&mdash;he knows!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Whisperer&mdash;who can he be?&rdquo; He said
the words aloud.</p>
<p>Alice, who sat almost at his feet, shook her
head. She did not know. No one did, at least
almost no one.</p>
<p>Was he a friend of the law, or its enemy?
A friend, Johnny would have said. And yet,
as he recalled how Spider had barely escaped
death when he attempted to take a picture of
that mysterious man of the tower, he could
not be sure. Spider had not repeated his hair-raising
experiment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>Curiously enough, it did not occur to one of
them that they might slip out quietly, pile into
their cars and go speeding back to the city.
They had come here with a plan. They were
to hang up their stockings, each of them, as if
he were once more a small child. They were
to stay all night, the ladies sleeping upstairs,
the men and boys in two tiny downstairs bedrooms.
There was to be joy in the morning
and feasting at noonday; a twenty-five pound
turkey awaited Madame&rsquo;s skill at stuffing and
baking. Who should interfere with these glorious
plans? No one, surely!</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime, Grace Krowl in her parlor
in the distant city had received a strange visitor.</p>
<p>Hardly had she returned from her little journey
dispensing Christmas cheer, when there
came a knock at her door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Springing up, she threw open the door, and
there before her, smiling like some fairy, was
a tiny little lady all dressed in furs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I received your letter.&rdquo; She stepped inside.
&ldquo;I came to see about the little trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;you&rsquo;re not Emily Anne!&rdquo; Grace
stared with all her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no!&rdquo; The little lady&rsquo;s laugh was
like the jingle of a silver bell. &ldquo;I am her niece,
Miss Baxter. Aunt Emily is dead, I am sorry
to say&mdash;has been for two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; There was a note of genuine sadness
in Grace&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Ex&mdash;excuse me!&rdquo; she apologized.
&ldquo;But I came almost to know her by
the lovely things in her trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you did.&rdquo; The little lady beamed.
&ldquo;She was a choice soul, Aunt Emily Anne!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me&mdash;&rdquo; She dropped into a chair.
&ldquo;Your letter interested me <i>so</i> much. Won&rsquo;t you
tell me how you came into possession of this
trunk, and how you came to write that wonderful
letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful letter?&rdquo; the girl thought. &ldquo;At
last one has returned to give thanks. How gorgeous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did tell Miss Baxter all she wished to
know about the trunk and the letters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But this Bible?&rdquo; The little lady&rsquo;s eyes
gleamed. &ldquo;You say it is worth several thousands
of dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it.&rdquo; Grace nodded her head.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the signature verified. It is genuine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Miss Baxter, &ldquo;let us form a
society, you and I&mdash;a &lsquo;Society for the Return
of Lost and Strayed Trunks.&rsquo; How does that
sound? There is a &lsquo;Society for the Return of
Lost and Strayed Cats.&rsquo; Trunks are more important
than cats, much more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are the only one who returned to
thank me. Besides,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! The plans,&rdquo; the little lady smiled, &ldquo;we
must work them out little by little. We shall
sell the Bible. I will add to that fund. This
will give us working capital. You shall be the
secretary, and do a great deal of the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be more wonderful,&rdquo; Grace
murmured, too overcome for speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now!&rdquo; Miss Baxter sprang to her feet.
&ldquo;This is Christmas Eve, and I must be on my
way. I&rsquo;ll see you again soon!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>With a wave of her hand, as if she might be
a feminine Santa Claus, she was gone, leaving
the astonished Grace to stare after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;is strange, so very
strange, so much mystery!&rdquo; She closed the
door, but did not stir from her place. She was
thinking, and they were long, long thoughts.</p>
<p>These thoughts were broken in upon by a
second knock on the door. No light tap of a
sparrow&rsquo;s wing, this knock, but one like the
thump of a policeman demanding admittance
in the name of the law. Her hand trembled as
she gripped the knob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />A PROMISE THAT IS A THREAT</h2>
<p>The silence in that little gray home out
there on the snow-blown prairies lasted
for ten long moments. To those who waited
time seemed to creep at a snail&rsquo;s pace. Drew
Lane, shifting uneasily in his chair, was about
to suggest something&mdash;he will never know
what&mdash;when, sudden as before, all thoughts
were drawn to the mysterious talking reflector
against the wall.</p>
<p>The instant a voice broke the silence in that
corner, Drew Lane leaped to his feet. Tom
Howe, crouching like a cat, remained motionless
in his chair. There was something menacing,
sinister, altogether terrible about that
voice. The words, more spoken than whispered,
caused Johnny&rsquo;s blood to freeze in his
veins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, you Hell hounds!&rdquo; Those were the
words. &ldquo;Listen! You whisper, do you? Well,
so do we! You narrow-cast, and you think we
can&rsquo;t listen. Well, we can!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; The voice became more terrible.
&ldquo;You have been on our trail long enough!
Public enemies! Bah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if choked with words, the voice ceased
for a second. Everyone in the room had turned
into a statue. Only the cat was unconscious
of it all. He purred loudly in his place among
the cushions. And the windmill, poor thing of
rusty steel, it uttered one more unearthly
scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; The voice was hoarse with hate.
&ldquo;We got you, see? Got all of you. You&rsquo;ll
never leave that place, see? Not one of you all!
Christmas Eve. It&rsquo;s a laugh!&rdquo; There came a
hoarse chuckle that was terrible to hear.
&ldquo;Hang up your stockings! Get &rsquo;em up quick!
We&rsquo;re coming to fill &rsquo;em, and we&rsquo;ll fill &rsquo;em right
with machine gun slugs! That&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;ll
be filled!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, everyone!&rdquo; The speaker&rsquo;s
voice dropped to a mocking imitation of a
radio announcer. &ldquo;Good-night. And a Merry
Christmas to all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full moment the silence in that little
parlor, that through the years had witnessed
so much of joy and sorrow, was profound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a joke,&rdquo; Spider said hoarsely at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joke!&rdquo; Drew Lane&rsquo;s lips were white.
&ldquo;I know that voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;that you
ladies were out of it. Those fellows have machine
guns. If they cut loose, they&rsquo;ll riddle this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a detective&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; Joyce Mills
stood up square shouldered and slim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I a slain policeman&rsquo;s widow.&rdquo; Madame
LeClare stood up at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I his child.&rdquo; Alice was not smiling as
she joined the two. There was a glint of fire
in her dark eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is that Iggy the Snake?&rdquo; Madame LeClare
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond doubt it is.&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s eyes were
gleaming. &ldquo;He and his gang, the men who
killed Jack LeClare, the men we swore to get.
And with God&rsquo;s help we&rsquo;ll get them yet!&rdquo; He
set his teeth hard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You ladies can shoot?&rdquo; he said in a changed
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As well as any man!&rdquo; Madame held up her
head proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good! Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; Drew moved to
the cupboard by the stairs. &ldquo;The Captain
showed me a new sort of gas bomb. Yes, here
it is. Puts &rsquo;em out completely for a full half
hour. Be swell if we could use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll be a respectful distance away,&rdquo;
Tom Howe objected. &ldquo;How can we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Have to trust our automatics,
I guess. Here!&rdquo; Drew handed one of his guns
to Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you.&rdquo; Tom passed a thing of blue
metal to Madame LeClare as if it were a bouquet
of roses. She accepted it with a bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no phone&mdash;no way of spreading an
alarm.&rdquo; Drew spoke calmly. &ldquo;No one passes
this way at night. They&rsquo;ve got till morning.
Johnny, has the place a cellar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a hole for vegetables&mdash;no windows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No use to us. They&rsquo;d burn the house.
Smother us like rats. We&rsquo;ll have to stand our
ground, every one at a window. This is the
way our forefathers fought savages.&rdquo; His voice
had grown husky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are more savage than they!&rdquo; Madame
LeClare added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might make a dash for it. Try getting
away in the cars,&rdquo; Tom Howe suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be all set to mow us down as we
come out,&rdquo; Drew objected. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not been
watching, you know. But we&rsquo;d better be, right
now!&rdquo; His tone changed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll set a watch
at the windows. There&rsquo;s one on every side.
We&rsquo;ll watch in pairs. Misery loves company.
You and you there; you and you&mdash;&rdquo; He pointed
them to their places rapidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Johnny found himself settled upon a cushion
behind the low window in the small southwest
room. At his side, so close he fancied he felt
her heart beat, was Alice LeClare. He thanked
Drew for that. If the watch were to be long,
here was pleasant company. Then, too, he had
learned by the glint in her dark eyes that, if
worse came to worst, if he were wounded, out
of the combat, this splendid girl would fight
over him as bravely and savagely as any Indian
fighter&rsquo;s wife had fought over her fallen
man.</p>
<p>It was strange, the silence of the place, once
they were all settled and the lights out. The
fire in the cracked old stove shone red. The
little clock that had ticked the good Captain&rsquo;s
boyhood quite away, as if it would end the
suspense and bring the dawn at once, raced
more furiously than before. The girl at Johnny&rsquo;s
side breathed steadily, evenly, as if this
were but the night before Christmas and she
waiting for Santa Claus in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a girl!&rdquo; Johnny thought.</p>
<p>His eyes strayed through the open door at
his back. Through it he caught the square of
light from the north window. A semi-circle of
shadow above its sill he knew to be Spider&rsquo;s
head. Spider was watching there alone. His
post was an important one. That window
looked out upon a small barn and the towering
cottonwood tree. The tree was fully six feet
through. The Captain had told of swinging
from its branches as a child.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; Johnny whispered to the girl,
&ldquo;sitting here in this quiet little gray house
where men and women have lived their lives
away without a breath to disturb their calm,
waiting for an attack. It&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s like the
silence that must have hung over the fields of
poppies in France during the Great War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll truly come?&rdquo; Alice
whispered back. &ldquo;Or was it just a scare? They
may be in Chicago, you know. The Whisperer
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not a mile away. They will come.
Drew believes they&rsquo;ll come, and Drew seldom
makes a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise me&mdash;&rdquo; She pressed his arm. &ldquo;If
I go to&mdash;to&mdash;to the Last Round-Up and you&mdash;you
are spared, you&rsquo;ll look after the boys and&mdash;and
help Gluck to be a good brave cop when
he grows up.&rdquo; There was a little tremor in
her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise!&rdquo; Johnny whispered huskily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>A moment later Johnny&rsquo;s eyes swept the
wide white field before him, then the narrow
road that lay beyond. For a space of seconds
his eyes remained fixed upon a dark spot on
that road. &ldquo;Does it move?&rdquo; he asked himself.
In the end he decided that it did not.</p>
<p>Breathing more easily, he turned to look
through the door at his back, into the room
beyond. He started and stared. Something
was missing. The dark semi-circle that had
been Spider&rsquo;s head was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo; he muttered low. To Alice
he whispered: &ldquo;Keep a sharp watch. I&rsquo;ll be
back.&rdquo; Next instant he was gliding noiselessly
across the floor.</p>
<p>Ten seconds and he was staring at a vacant
spot where the other boy had been. &ldquo;Spider!&rdquo;
He all but said the name aloud. &ldquo;Spider!
He is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instinctively his hand sought the latch to
the door close beside that north window. It
gave to his hand. &ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s not locked,&rdquo; he
whispered. &ldquo;But it <i>was</i> locked. I locked it myself.&rdquo;
Spider was gone, sure enough, not alone
from his post, but out of the building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>At once his head was in a whirl. What was
he to make of it? Was Spider yellow, after all?
Had he decided to make a break all by himself?
With his uncanny power of climbing, of getting
through places unobserved, he would almost
surely escape. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; he whispered,
&ldquo;is that like Spider?&rdquo; He could not feel that
it was. He recalled times when the boy had
appeared utterly fearless, absolutely loyal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, he was only a boy from the city
streets. Supposing&mdash;&rdquo; Doubt assailed him.
Supposing Spider had only pretended to be
loyal. Supposing that during all this time he
had been in league with Iggy the Snake and
his gang? Supposing it had been he who had
tipped off the gang to their plans for a Christmas
party!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and suppose it wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he whispered
almost fiercely.</p>
<p>One fact stood out clearly. Spider&rsquo;s post
was vacant. It must be filled at once.</p>
<p>After locking the door, he slid over to
Drew&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spider&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gone? Where?&rdquo; Drew did not raise his
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? His place is empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take it,&rdquo; was Drew&rsquo;s instant command.
&ldquo;Take Alice with you. I&rsquo;ll move over where
you were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he murmured as Johnny glided
away into the darkness. &ldquo;Spider&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />A STRANGE VICTORY</h2>
<p>Apparently it is true that, under certain
circumstances at least, one can recognize
a person by his whisper. Certain it is
that Grace Krowl, upon opening her door for
a second time that night and upon hearing the
whispered message, &ldquo;Merry Christmas, Grace
Krowl,&rdquo; said without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You are the Whisperer.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; The slim, gray-haired man before
her smiled. &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stepped aside. He entered and took a
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was generous of you to trust me,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;You will not regret it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see&mdash;&rdquo; His eyes strayed about the
place. &ldquo;I fitted these rooms up for myself.
Then, for reasons you shall know of later, I
was obliged to leave them. When I learned of
your presence here, I decided to trust you, and
to use you. I&mdash; You have Nida&rsquo;s story?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Grace nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is the daughter of a very old friend.&rdquo;
The little, gray-haired man leaned forward.
&ldquo;Will you tell me the story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace told the story as best she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as I thought.&rdquo; The Whisperer sprang
to his feet. &ldquo;That man, J. Templeton Semp, is
a rascal. He tried to hide his evil deeds by
persecuting others. I must go!&rdquo; He seized
his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who&mdash;who are you?&rdquo; Grace cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;I am Newton Mills.&rdquo;
Then he was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>What a commotion that declaration would
have caused among the watchers in the little
gray house on the prairies! Newton Mills,
Joyce Mills&rsquo; father, boon companion of Drew
Lane, Tom Howe and Johnny Thompson&mdash;Newton
Mills come to life and he, of all men,
the Whisperer! But no word of this could
reach them now.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was cold over there by the north window
of the little gray house. Before he and Alice
established themselves there, Johnny gathered
up his heavy coat and wrapped it about the
girl. He was very close to her now, this brave
and beautiful child of a slain policeman. They
were facing death together, these two. And
death drew them closer.</p>
<p>Bleak night was outside, and out there
somewhere in hiding, creeping up behind that
barn or the grove where the Captain had
played as a boy, or perhaps behind the great
cottonwood just before them, death was coming
nearer. Johnny was seized with an involuntary
shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, my friend Johnny?&rdquo; The little
Canadian&rsquo;s shoulder touched his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Only thinking.&rdquo; He laughed a
low, uncertain laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said a moment later in
a voice that was all but a whisper, &ldquo;that old
barn behind the cottonwood was standing
when the Captain was a boy? On rainy days
they played in the hay, climbed high and
pushed one another down, made swings of the
hay ropes and leaped into the mow from twenty
feet in air. They played hide and seek, boys
and girls together. Sounds sort of peaceful
and joyous, doesn&rsquo;t it? Not&mdash;not like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make it seem so real. Perhaps, after
all, this is only a dream. Or, or only a trick
to frighten us. Christmas morning will come
as it came in those good days. Stockings all
in a row.&rdquo; Her voice was dreamy. &ldquo;Presents,
and a fire laughing up the chimney. All that
and&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny!&rdquo; She broke off suddenly to grip
his arm. &ldquo;What was that? A shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s right hand gripped his automatic.
Surely there had come a sharp crack. It sounded
strange in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Board nails snapping in the frost perhaps.&rdquo;
He relaxed a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Johnny!&rdquo; She gripped his arm till
it hurt. &ldquo;Look! Some dark object tumbling
about under that huge tree. It&mdash;I think it
looks like a man!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>Johnny was on his feet. &ldquo;Drew! Drew Lane!
Come here quick!&rdquo; He all but shouted the
words.</p>
<p>Before the call died on his lips, Drew was
at his side. By that time not one dark object,
but three were to be seen tumbling about on
the snow beneath the giant cottonwood.
Their antics were grotesque in the extreme&mdash;like
men sewed into canvas sacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; Johnny hazarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or it&rsquo;s a decoy to call us out,&rdquo; Drew replied
dryly.</p>
<p>What was to be done? Surely here was a
quandary. One of the figures had stiffened and
lay quite still like a corpse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be faked,&rdquo; Drew said grimly. &ldquo;But a
fellow has to see.&rdquo; One hand on the door, the
other gripping his automatic, he was prepared
for a dash, when Johnny pulled him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Let me go! You are older. If anything
goes wrong, you&rsquo;ll be needed here. You
must remember the women.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All&mdash;all right.&rdquo; Drew backed away reluctantly.
Then, standing up at full height, ready
for instant action, he prepared to protect Johnny
as best he might.</p>
<p>Johnny was out of the door and away like
a shot. Not so fast, however, but that a dark,
muffled figure followed him.</p>
<p>Reaching the first prostrate form, he uttered
a low exclamation. It was a man. Apparently
quite unconscious, he lay there, his face half
buried in the snow. There was a curious odor
about the place. Johnny felt a faint dizziness
in his head.</p>
<p>He stepped to the next figure. To his surprise
and horror he saw it was Spider. He too
lay motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gas!&rdquo; a voice said in his ear. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
see they&rsquo;ve been gassed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wheeled about to find himself staring in
the face of the little French Canadian girl,
Alice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out of it!&rdquo; She dragged him away.
&ldquo;There is still some of that gas in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>Johnny had got a little more of that gas than
he thought. He did not lose consciousness, but
he did have only a hazy notion of that which
went on about him. It will always remain so&mdash;how
the other members of the party came
swarming out, how they found four members
of the &ldquo;Massacre Parade&rdquo; prostrate on the
snow, and Spider beside them on the ground
with a broken arm&mdash;all this will always be a
dream to Johnny. So too will be the story of
how Drew and Tom went after the missing
Iggy, who was not one of the four under the
tree, and how they found him waiting in a
high-powered car, and, having been fired upon,
how they mowed him down with the very machine
gun that had been loaded for the purpose
of massacring women, men and girls
alike.</p>
<p>The effect of the gas did not last more than
twenty minutes. The words used by the four
would-be savage massacre men when they
found handcuffs on their wrists and clothes-line
rope bound round their legs, were scarcely
in keeping with the spirit of Christmas. It
will not seem strange that no one cared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>As for Spider, he had some explaining to
do. When a doctor had set his broken arm
and he had fully recovered from his share of
the gas, he told a strange story.</p>
<p>He had caught a glimpse of someone dodging
behind the old barn. Putting the whole
thing together, he had decided that the men
with machine guns would take their stand behind
the giant cottonwood. Its thick base
would offer perfect protection from bullets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if only I can beat
them to the tree and climb it, with that gas
bomb on my back, I&rsquo;ll be in a position to put
them all to sleep at once. There wasn&rsquo;t a minute
to lose, so, without saying anything, I
made a dash for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s twenty feet to the first branch!&rdquo;
Johnny protested. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you make it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bark of that old tree,&rdquo; said Spider with
a smile, &ldquo;is like the edge of inch-thick boards
sticking out. Nothing easier than getting a
grip and going up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you,&rdquo; Johnny agreed. &ldquo;But you were
found on the ground,&rdquo; he objected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Things didn&rsquo;t go just right.&rdquo; Spider indulged
in a wry smile. &ldquo;I got up the tree all
right. They did their part, came and got under.
Then I saw something I hadn&rsquo;t counted
on&mdash;saw the tops of heads, yours and Alice&rsquo;s
by that window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten seconds more, and they&rsquo;d have riddled
you with bullets. Guess I got excited; must
have moved. Anyway, one of &rsquo;em spotted me
and fired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullet hit my arm. Lost my balance, and
down I came, gas bomb and all. The bomb
burst all right. And, well, you know the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alice!&rdquo; Johnny was looking into the little
Canadian&rsquo;s eyes. He was thinking, &ldquo;What if
that machine gun had stuttered just once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he realized that in the face of death
Alice had followed him into the night, he
wanted awfully to cry, then to seize the little
Canadian and kiss her on both cheeks. Being
a modest youth, he merely flushed and did
neither the one nor the other, which was just
as well, since Alice could understand blushes
quite as readily as tears and other things.</p>

<br />THE WHISPERER TALKS</h2>
<p>Routing out a farmer a half mile north
of the Captain&rsquo;s old home, Drew Lane
got the local sheriff on the wire and told him
what had been done. An hour later the four
prisoners were behind bars in the county jail,
and Iggy the Snake, who had put an end to
a half-score of useful men, was in the morgue.</p>
<p>The clock was striking midnight when Drew
got Captain Burns on the wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck?&rdquo; he asked the Captain with a
voice hard to control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some luck, Drew,&rdquo; the Captain answered.
&ldquo;Tell you about it later. Thought I had something
more. It went up like old St. Nick&rsquo;s
reindeers, straight into thin air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive out early in the morning.&rdquo; There
was suppressed animation in Drew&rsquo;s tone.
&ldquo;We got some Christmas presents for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not what we been after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;N-o-o!&rdquo; The Captain fairly stuttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All five. One tried, condemned and executed;
four behind the bars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turkey weighs twenty-five pounds.&rdquo; He
changed his tone hastily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be stuffed with
oysters and other things. You&rsquo;ll be out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you&rsquo;re up,&rdquo; the Captain rumbled.
&ldquo;Merry Christmas!&rdquo; He hung up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> Christmas at that,&rdquo; Drew murmured
after consulting his watch.</p>
<p>It was late when the stockings were filled
that night. Is it any wonder that presents
were sadly mixed, that Johnny received a
powder-puff and Alice a bright and shiny toy
pistol? But what did it matter?</p>
<p>The sun was high when the young people
piled out of their bunks in the cold little bedrooms.
Already the savory odors of a feast,
of a turkey roasting, cranberries stewing,
mince pie baking, was in the air. What did
presents matter? A feast, and joyous and
more peaceful times were just ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>The Captain did not keep his promise. He
arrived at ten o&rsquo;clock instead of at dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to wait for this young lady,&rdquo; he explained,
helping Grace Krowl out of his car.
&ldquo;Wanted her to have a look at one of your
friends,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;No time to talk of
crooks, but that man J. Templeton Semp, the
dutiful house detective, is none other than
Dapper Dan Drew in other circles, and Dapper
Dan, as you know, is one of the men you
have in jail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It often happens,&rdquo; he added when the surprise
had subsided, &ldquo;that men who are so very
good at enforcing little unimportant regulations,
such as the J. Templeton Semp Black
List, are very bad in other ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait!&rdquo; the Captain exclaimed. &ldquo;I have
still another guest.&rdquo; He gave Joyce Mills a
strange look, then he roared:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Man, come out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out stepped Newton Mills. Like a flash, his
daughter was in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And might I add,&rdquo; said Grace Krowl, &ldquo;that
he is also the mysterious Whisperer of the air!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;calls for a lot of
explaining. Suppose we retire to the parlor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s really nothing very mysterious
about that whisper business,&rdquo; said Newton
Mills when they were all gathered about the
fire. &ldquo;I became interested in something they
call narrow-casting. It&rsquo;s one of the uses of
the electric eye. You really talk down a beam
of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk down a beam of light!&rdquo; someone exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really very simple.
You talk into a microphone. An instrument
takes up the sound impulses of your
voice and changes them to light impulses.
These impulses may be sent down a beam of
light a mile, ten, twenty, thirty miles. How
far? No one knows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very special reflector catches those light
impulses. A mechanism containing an electric
eye changes those light impulses back into
sound impulses. And then you hear my voice
thirty miles away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The wonderful part is, Captain&mdash;&rdquo; He
leaned forward eagerly. &ldquo;Only a person with
the proper mechanism in the line of that ray
of light can hear them! Think of being able
to sit in my high tower and send secret messages
to a score of my fellow detectives, and
never a crook listening in! I tell you it is going
to be a great thing for crime hunters in
the future!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; Johnny asked, &ldquo;that you
in your high tower came near being the end
of this young giant?&rdquo; He nodded toward
Spider.</p>
<p>Newton Mills stared in surprise. Then he
said, dryly, &ldquo;A caller should send in his card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how was it you could see me as well
as speak to me?&rdquo; Grace Krowl asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Television.&rdquo; Newton Mills smiled afresh.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d had a set installed in that room. It&rsquo;s a
rather crude set. But you can see a person
well enough to recognize him even now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that must have been why I could see
Iggy the Snake and the stolen bonds back
there in the &lsquo;House of Magic,&rsquo;&rdquo; Johnny put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably was,&rdquo; Newton Mills agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of those bonds,&rdquo; said Captain
Burns, &ldquo;last night I recovered all but a few of
them. Great luck! Fine Christmas present for
that closed bank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for the depositors,&rdquo; Drew Lane added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Madame LeClare, appearing
in the doorway, &ldquo;soup&rsquo;s on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On with the feast!&rdquo; cried the Captain.</p>
<p>A moment later they were all seated about
a broad table that groaned under its weight
of good things to eat.</p>
<p>Bowing their heads, they sang their grace
before meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace on earth, good will toward men!&rdquo;
the Captain rumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only the men of this earth had good will
toward one another, we could throw away our
sticks and guns and come to a peaceful spot
like this to live all our days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a very merry time they had in the
Captain&rsquo;s boyhood home that Christmas day
and a joyous journey they made back to the
city. And why not? Had they not been sentenced
to death by their enemies and the enemies
of all honest men, and had they not escaped
and triumphed?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>Next day Johnny returned to the &ldquo;House of
Magic.&rdquo; He found, however, that much of its
charm had gone with the solving of its many
mysteries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was television that made it possible
for you to see your friend Iggy and the
stolen bonds,&rdquo; Felix admitted freely enough.
&ldquo;It is very imperfect at present. The time will
come, however, when you will be able to look
in upon wrongdoers from some spot miles
away, and perhaps,&rdquo; he added with a chuckle,
&ldquo;we will be able to look right through walls
of cement, stone or steel. Who dares say we
won&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he went on a moment later,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;d like to know what we were about in
that balloon when the long one and the short
one, who beyond doubt were Iggy and one of
his pals, cut us loose in that balloon. We were
about to talk down a beam of light. Shortly
after that I made the acquaintance of Newton
Mills. He told me he had been working on
that. We arranged to complete the experiment
from the Sky Ride tower. He swore me
to secrecy&mdash;so you see I couldn&rsquo;t well take
you in on it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; yawned Johnny, &ldquo;looks as if it were
going to be a trifle dull around here for a
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be and might not,&rdquo; the inventor&rsquo;s
son grinned. &ldquo;Father is working on some marvelous
things. Don&rsquo;t go far from here without
leaving your address. We may need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep in touch,&rdquo; Johnny agreed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the peace and good will the
brave Captain spoke of over the Christmas
feast in his old home does not yet exist. The
world is still at war with itself. Because of
this we are likely to have more to tell our
young adventurers in the near future. If this
proves true, you will find it recorded in a book
called <i>Wings of Mystery</i>.</p>
